"ej1kfi","1577987776","WIBTA for not returning my nieces pajamas that got left behind because my SIL is disgusting","My Inlaws came to visit for the holidays this past weekend. They live 6 hours away. My MIL gives each grandkid a pair of pajamas for Christmas. My niece is 18 months old& on the trip up peed all over everything so we washed it and dried it for her so they could take it back home. SIL forgot it which she didnt even know about until I told her she forgot it. She now wants us to pay for expidited shipping to return them.

Why I dont want to return them:

During the visit my SIL trashed our new house during the visit. SIL has Bipolar and refuses treatment. SIL is a hoarder & her daughter has more clothes/toys then she has attention/ care.

SIL(35f)/BIL(39m) left unwrapped soiled diapers all over the place.We told her they need to be thrown away and not left out because that's disgusting and unhygienic.Some places she left them was: On the kitchen counter next to food. In the bathtub after niece got a bath. When they left we were cleaning up and found several in a garbage can underneath the garbage bag can. We threw out 2 kitchen bags of garbage they left behind.

We have glasses from our wedding that are very thin and easily breakable that we only use on special occasions. They are stored on a high shelf out of reach. We bought a dozen non breakable drinking glasses plus we had maybe half a dozen other non breakable glasses just so no one would have to use anything breakable. We saw SIL drinking out of them told her we bought stuff and had other glasses because we didnt want them to break. She broke 2 glasses didnt tell us and my dog got a sliver of glass in his paw. He cant put any weight on his front foot and need to take him to the vet.

She screamed, name called & belittled her husband multiple times. Once was to the point of tears, once was in public when we went out to breakfast everytime is in front of their daughter. We had to step in and tell her to stop everytime.

We had made up a bed for them when they came in guest room. She complained it was too cold. We offered them extra blankets which she refused. She cranked our heat from 70 to 78 the first night and we were roasting.The second night we moved her daughter into our toddlers room because it was still to cold for her. Then they brought up an air mattress bed and set it up in the living room. Not much room to walk around but whatever. They wound up leaving it up and sleeping on couches.

TL;DR We essentially waited on SIL hand and foot, she bitched the entire time and was a shitty house guest. She forgot her daughters christmas pajamas from grandma and wants us to pay for shipping them back.

WIBTA if I told her no she needs to take better care of her things?

Edit: asked SIL to arrange a courier for pick up or to venmo us for shipping... she is not pleased. Thanks all for advice on how to avoid being the asshole","1577990982.0","Not the A-hole","4","39"
"ej1n0f","1577988094","AITA for confronting a coworker after a company pot luck","So, our company was having a Christmas pot luck and everyone brought something of their own to it. Pretty standard.

Unfortunately, not enough planning was involved and while my coworkers were enjoying the pot luck, I verbally volunteered to sit out for a bit and cover the walk-in customer service portion of my workplace. About a hour goes by and when the people who I was covering for got back, I made my way up to the front office.

Along the way, a coworker asked me if I got any of the lunch. I said no because I was just covering the back. He tells me that the food is all gone and he didn't get any either.

I make my way to where the food was and there was a single aluminum tray that was covered. I assumed it was the food all consolidated into one container so I open it. Then a coworker comes over and puts her hand on the lid, closing it and then said ""Don't touch that!"" I asked ""is this not the food from the pot luck?"" She says ""it's the leftovers."" So I said ""Ok, cool. I haven't had any so I'll just grab some of this."" She says ""No. I'm taking this home, it's for my husband. He is working a 16 hour shift today and he's going to come home hungry."" I reply with ""So, your husband, who doesn't work here, is getting food that everyone else brought in for the company pot luck while people WITHIN the company aren't getting any of it?"" She says ""Like I said he is coming home from a 16 hour work shift and you had a hour to grab some.""

This got me a little upset and I retaliated with ""I was covering the back so everyone could enjoy their meal. Both \_\_\_\_ and I never got any food. Is your husband 10 years old and can't feed himself? Or pick something up on his way home? He has to rely on you to provide food, that isn't even yours to take, for him? I'm only half done my coffee, does he want that too? God forbid he has to put water into the coffee maker at home.""

She replied with ""It's not my fault you covered the back and didn't get any. Maybe you should think about taking some back with you next time instead of complaining about it."" That's when another coworker very calmly told us to back off each other and take a breather.

The woman who had the leftovers has been going around to coworkers telling them how much of an asshole I am for confronting her like that and was visibly upset with me.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: okay, I've stepped away from this for a while and thought I would get some reoccurring questions out of the way: 

\-She ended up with the leftovers because she showed no signs of compromise and I didnt want to restart the fire. 

\-I went to the closest fast food restaurant and picked up some food for both my coworker who didnt receive any food either and myself 

\-I brought food as well to the pot luck. It was $40 worth of fresh fruit cut up the morning of because they wanted something light and healthy. That's all I brought so I had nothing to eat for the rest of the day which was a factor of why I got upset.","1578035347.0","Not the A-hole","5473","989"
"ej1pb9","1577988356","AITA for not taking out the bins this week?","Okay so I live with 3 girls in student accommodation, we have a bin rota. The bin rota is as follows;

Week 1: Me (as I was the first to move in)
Week 2: Girl A
Week 3: Girl B
Week 4: Girl C

Recently we've all been away for Christmas, new years etc.
 I went on holiday to Budapest the week before Christmas, on which it was Girl B's bin week (16th-22nd). She took the bins out.
Then Christmas week came around (23rd- 29th) which should have been Girl C's week. However she was away.
 I come back from Budapest for roughly 3 days (20th - 23rd). The bins are full, it is not my bin week but I empty the bins and take them out.
On the 23rd I go home for Christmas. I come back on the 27th. Because it's only me and Girl A in the flat, there's barely anything in the bins, I empty whatever is there and carry on with my life. 
This week (Girl A's week) the normal and recycling bins are overflowing, I had to empty the bin even though it wasn't my week and I left it in the kitchen to be taken down when Girl A got around to it. 
The bins are full because Girl C had a house party without asking and filled up all the bins while cleaning up at 6 at night the day after (Girl C has only been here for about 2 months and has had multiple parties and pre-drinks in the kitchen without asking and doesn't clean up after herself until late the day after which interferes with cooking and generally wanting to be in the kitchen without being met with the stench of vodka and day old beer).
It's now Thursday and I'm annoyed because the bin hasn't been taken and there's now a puddle of bin juice on the floor. I leave a message in the group chat saying that the bin needs to be taken out and receive multiple messages from Girl B and C saying the bin rota is shit and doesn't work and that they're sick of taking out the bins/cleaning up everyone else's mess. I just said that I've been emptying the bin on my weeks and clean up after myself whenever I use the kitchen.
Girl A hasn't said anything but I didn't want to call people out, my aim was to be non confrontational and just have the gross bin taken out by whoever was responsible for it that week, but it seems like everyone is attacking me even though I've been upholding my side of the responsibility.

"ej1qur","1577988540","AITA wanting the door locked?","Background: So basically the issue is that my mom and stepdad have been leaving the front door unlocked in the morning when they leave for work while the rest of us are sleeping. They usually leave around 7 am and me (19F) and my siblings (17F, 14M, 11M) are off from school for the holidays so are still asleep at this time. This used to not be a problem because I used to work at the same place before I left for college and was always last out so I'd lock the door.

Mom's argument: We live in a safe neighborhood so there's no reason to lock the door. She says that if there's a problem we can call the police, but that nothing is going to happen because it's such a small town (population ~250) and it's a very rural area (20 mins to the next town, 1hr to nearest city). She thinks that I'm being paranoid because I moved to a bigger city for college and there's more crime there. She just doesn't think it's a big deal

My argument: Even if our area is relatively safe, I don't feel comfortable with the door being left unlocked while everyone in the house is asleep. I've been setting an alarm to get up and lock the door after they leave because they refuse to lock it, and it's disrupting my sleep. I might be paranoid, but there's no police station in our town and if something were to happen we would have no way to defend ourselves.

"ej1szl","1577988797","AITA if I tell my mother to mind her own business when she visits","I live alone in a studio apartment, and organize my things in a way that's more friendly to my daily habits. Think User Experience tailored to how I live ex. Pomade on the desk next to my table mirror instead of restroom cabinet. Another example would be having bags on the couch for easy grabbing as I'm either using a gym bag or my work bag.

The problem is that my mother visits and she always goes into a rant that the room is a mess. This leads to get cleaning and messing with the objects in my room. Granted she visits on the worst times like after I had friends over or after I had just gone to the hospital.

I honestly think my practical way of living is ""organized"" and it should depend on the persons habits. Organized should not be clearing as much space as possible so AITA if I tell her to stop bitching about how ""messy"" and""disorganized"" I am etc?

Note: 
She owns the apartment. She also doesn't want me to move out of it even though I could be nearer to work and split the bills with other people. I vacuum and scrub the floors every Sunday.

Info: I pay the condo dues and bills.

"ej1urm","1577989020","AITA for getting my coworker fired ?","I work at a dealership as a porter/lot attendant in the service department. We have a service lane where cars come in to drop off their vehicles that need maintenance, our job is to do write ups of their vehicle , we list the color, customers name , brand of car , model , any damage, mileage , VIN# , etc. We also fix small issues like if cars are low on oil , coolant , air , etc . There’s ALOT more to it but to keep it short when their car is fixed we go and grab their car for them . 

So let’s say my coworker name is named Patrick . He’s been here longer than I have about 4 years . honestly he’s a great guy to be with he’s done me favors and I’ve done him favors , he’s a genuine cool guy . I never hated him as a person just his actions . He is VERY VERY LAZY  , to the point where I literally do 90% of the work. He randomly disappears at random times of our shift for up to 40 mins . Most of the time he leaves when he sees a car coming in , he tells me he’ll be right back and then gets up walks away and As soon as he does I’ll see a car come in . He also does this when it gets busy. We have a schedule of all the appointments and my guess is that he looks at it , sees what time a good amount of people are coming and leaves before they do, and everytime he’s comes back he says “I’m sorry I was helping , blah blah blah “. I confronted him about and he explained it wasn’t on purpose and he will tell me when he’s leaves and why . I accepted it and thought it was going to be over, boy was i wrong. Sometimes we would have to go out and pick up customers who didn’t have transportation, they would give us a time to leave to go pick them up . Everytime Patrick had to pick someone up , he would slack off beforehand . For example he had to pick someone up at 9:30 , at 8:50 he disappears and comes back around 9:25 then says he has to leave to pick a customer up . He also takes forever to get there and come back , he even stops to get food sometimes ( sometimes he gets me some but still) . I asked other coworkers if they noticed also and they told me my manager knows he disappears but never fired him . One day I decided to tell management about it and they run this secret poll to see how many write ups we did. I didn’t know about this at all but they ended up finding out that through the week that I did 156 writes up while he only did 30ish. Patrick was immediately fired . Someone ended up telling Patrick and he gave me a call mad at me for telling management and not coming to him at all . ( even though I did multiple times , I would even joke around and call him  Houdini) . I knew he was living paycheck to paycheck and he told me that I made him absolutely broke and had to live with his brother. What do you guys think AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","17","24"

I am 19M and my downstairs neighbour is 70ishF
I recently moved into a flat that I Bought and upon meeting the neighbour who lived below me she seemed very pleasant.
After living here she has been always complaining about noise. Slamming doors and footsteps etc.
She has never complained about the noise of the TV and once texted me to complain about hearing music which I then instantly turned down.

I have been slowly renovating my flat as it was in a bad state when I first moved in which she complains about also to her landlord. 

I have taken steps to cut down noise I.E extra insulation under the carpet and felt pads to stop doors slamming.

I am 19 and do have a social life which includes having friends round (no more than 3) and getting in late sometimes from a night out.
I never have parties in my flat for the reason of not wanting to upset her.

I had one friend over on the 23rd of December which we stayed up drinking and watching movies until 2am but kept the noise at hushed voices 

And on new year's eve me my gf and 2 friends had a drink at 3am before the friends left to go home


When I first moved in she told me how the last owner in my flat was also very noisy causing her to move out and then move back in after he left, which she nows says she wants to do again.

"ej1y27","1577989432","AITA for asking my ex to drive the kids to me just once","My ex and I have 2 kids, 12 and 14. We’ve been divorced for 7 years. She has primary custody and I get one weekend a month. She also makes considerably more than I do, but I still pay child support.

She had it written into our custody agreement that I have to drive to pick up and drop off the kids during my weekends. She lives an hour away so it’s an extra 4 hours in the car during that week. I usually do it without complaint but my car is in the shop right now so I can’t get to the kids. I asked her to drive them to me and she said no. I asked her to pay for a car service because I’m tight on money right now and she said no. I asked her what the fuck my child support is paying for if she can’t even afford a car service. 

She responded telling me to talk to her lawyer. I talked to my oldest on the phone and told him the reason I couldn’t see him is because I didn’t have a car and his mom wouldn’t drive him to me. I guess he said something to his mom because she just informed me that she is taking me to court. I’m obviously in a very tight spot now, but am I the asshole for asking her to make the drive one time that I make every month and asking her to pay for a car since she makes more AND gets money from me monthly?","False","Asshole","32","59"
"ej1yks","1577989489","AITA for wanting to wear a formal, gothic dress to my cousin's wedding?","So one of my two closest cousins are getting married. Yay! Only I'm really nervous about it because of that particular situation. He's one of my closest cousins.

Also everything I know about my cousin's soon-to-be wife is she is quite nice. Which is why I am making double the effort and have double the anxiety about it. I bought make up and a dress for it, using the color scheme it is alright to wear black and teal said by the bride, to get myself a black dress. 

Problem for my Dad, and my Mom too but she was being nicer, is that this dress is kind of gothic. [The Dress](https://www.dresslily.com/lace-panel-long-sleeve-maxi-product3373641.html) It's a long, ankle length dress with lace sleeves. Conservative neckline which is one of the reasons I really chose it. I love it! Though I didn't work out the zipper. I planned to either wear it with a top or buy another one if I couldn't get the dress zipper working. 

Now my Dad said he would not be seen with me if I went in that dress and he would even buy me another dress for it. No worries then. I don't need to wear the dress. So I am not wearing the dress. But they proceed to call me ridiculous for not only presuming that the wedding colors being black and teal meant the colors could only be black and teal... Alright, very literal person and I have seen worse reaches from the bride then a request for two colors where one is likely to be in a person's closet. 

But they proceed to say that a gothic sort of formal dress is not appropriate for a wedding after talking to me about how silly I am for the color scheme = color preference mistake. AITA for erring on the side of formal for my cousin's wedding with plans to cover up the lace? 

My parents don't think a gothic dress counts as formal. My Mom in particular added later that she also thinks a dress that long would make me seem like I was a part of the wedding party and be mistaken for it. So I describe my parents' position on it fairly.","False","Not enough info","49","82"

"ej27pa","1577990564","AITA for not going to my old best friend's baby shower?","For needed context, we used to have a very tight 3-friend-circle between myself, A, and B. The usual bachelor type friends that met in late teens/early 20s. B ends up married, not much changes. B has a kid, and he essentially falls out because other things have priority, we all understand.

&nbsp;

Myself and A remain best friends for quite some time after, and he meets a girl who already has a kid. He marries her very shortly after and is essentially powerleveled into dad-hood. I don't really care for his wife to begin with, but mostly due to personal reasons. We have had a few interactions (mostly him asking me to do favors for him like watch his dog while he travels for free, and never receiving thanks etc) that are very unlike (the old) him, and left a sour taste in my mouth, so it seemed to just expedite the falling out.

&nbsp;

""A"" and I, despite working right next to each other in the same office and maintaining a healthy/fun working relationship, essentially cut all outside-work contact. We never hang out and rarely speak, although he is now rekindled good friends with B, because they're both married with kids at this point.

&nbsp;

Recent development is that A is now having a baby with his wife, and while I'm very happy for him, I still don't really see any obligation to physically show up. I'll get them a gift, like I said, i'm happy for them, it's just things have changed drastically.
I've laid this out to my GF and she thinks i'm a super asshole and being a baby. Maybe it's the introvert in me, but I don't see what a physical presence has to do with this to begin with. However, he and his wife gave me a hard time about it after I declined an RSVP.

So I only gift shopped for my immediate family (parents, wife, and kids). Usually I also buy presents for my siblings and two best friends. I don't know if they expect gifts or not, but I don't spend a lot on them, usually around ~$20 each. In my mind it is just a simple, easy gesture to tell them that I love them. They also usually send me a simple Christmas present.

Well, I didn't send those simple presents this year. My parents came by with their customary gifts for our family and their grandkids (my kids) before they traveled for the holidays. I got a Christmas card from one sister, but I heard nothing from any of my other siblings or friends. I'm beginning to think that they view Christmas giving as a tedious chore, because they never send anything until *after* they receive a gift from me.

I'm thinking about just not buying them gifts anymore. I don't care if my siblings and friends don't get me presents, I don't think I have a sense of entitlement or need the attention per se.

"ej2c9m","1577991121","AITA for wanting to wear my kimono outside my room?","When my (19F) mother and my father got a divorce 4 years ago, I was confused and devastated. When my mom told us that she had gotten a new boyfriend I was of course shocked at first, but he is a nice guy and we have a lot of things in common, but about 2 years after they wanted to move in together. They got together some months after her and my dads divroce. My 2 little sisters and I were not ready for this at the time. Whilst he is kind and cares deeply for our mom, he is also very hard to get to know and he and my sisters are all introverts, including mysel so it was hard getting any of us to take the initiative. One of many issues that I had with the two moving together was the fact that I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around in my nightwear, underwear etc. when her boyfriend was around and therefor I didn't feel ready to move in with him. This didn't seem to be an issue for her and we moved in with him not long after.

Today I was going out to get some water. I was wearing a red bathrobe my boyfriend gave me for christmas without a bra underneath. The robe has a low cut, but does not directly show melons unless you specifically pull it down. I always make sure to pull it up before going out, as to not have it be too revealing. Her boyfriend was upstairs and she was in the kitchen. She then confronts me about my kimono being too revealing and that she thinks it's innapropriate that I wear it in front of her boyfriend and I honestly get quite upset. I tell her that  I was very clear and reminded her about this being an issue for me when they decided they wanted to move in with eachother and she responded saying that it was a bullsh\*t excuse and that I clearly didn't seem to have an issue with it anymore. I tried explaining to her that I did not consider the kimono revealing and she wanted me to pull it up even more as to not have my melons hang out everywhere (they weren't). She asked me if I would be cool with her walking around with her top naked in front of my boyfriend and in my mind that analogy did not make sense whatsoever.

Visibly uncomfortable and irritated I tell her that I'll go change my clothes and then she starts backpeddling saying that I am entitled to wear what I want, but that she doesn't like it. At this point I don't feel comfortable in my clothes anymore and change it to something that completely covers up the breast area. At dinner she starts the conversation again in front of my sisters and her boyfriend, due to my visible irritation and I tell her straight up that part of feeling at home for me is being able to wear what I want. We continue arguing for a while and at last I tell her that I'll just wear it in my room instead.

But AITA for wanting to wear my bathrobe outside of my room? I really can't seem to figure out who's right and who's wrong and whether my judgement is clouded due to our past confrontations.

I was also the one who paid for the car to be repaired as well as I paid insurance including the cost of buying into the insurance with all my cash. He has his own car and yet chooses to drive mine. He also got into an accident, which wasn’t his fault. The cost to repair was only a bumper and it cost 200$ to fix, we got a pay check of roughly 1400.

At the time, i was expecting to get compensated for all my expenses, instead I got a 100$ and a free months of insurance and he pocketed the rest. Really swell guy right?

My father recently came back into my life after starting a company that has been modestly successful. He gifted me a new car a 2008 Nissan Altima which I’m really happy to own. I need to fix the CAT convertor and my step dad agreed reluctantly to let me join his insurance. All of a sudden however he refused to give the cars title so I can sell the older car and use the money to not only fix the CAT but also help get my own insurance. 

He is holding my car hostage and constantly demonizing my father as a “horrible father.” But my father has came into my life, reimbursed me for paying my college tuition, helped me give my mother money for bills and rent and even gifted me a car. I don’t care that he disagreed about not letting me join his insurance and that’s fine. I am annoyed that he is not letting me get the title to sell my car that I paid for in its entirety.

"ej2idh","1577991832","WIBTA for inviting everyone from my high school class but one girl to my wedding?","The high school I (F23) went to lasted five years, three that we spent in boarding house and two that we lived in flats close to the school building. That made me and my 32 class mates grow really close and we meet up multiple times a year and whenever one of us has a big life event happening, like weddings. And even though I'm not totally close with all of them, I love them all to death, well, with one exception.

I'm getting married next year and right now we're looking at the guest list. I'm the fifth from my class to get married and the four before me all invited everyone from our class. I would love to continue this ""tradition"" but I just... I just can't stand this one girl.

She's a huge narcissist, which is a trait I hate. Maybe I was a bit jealous about all the attention she got, maybe our personalities were just too different, idk, but I spent the majority of our five school years together by ignoring her. It was fine, we still got along okay. But in our fourth year we did a school project and she was the project manager. I don't want to get into too much detail but she loved being the center of attention and was constantly making mountains out of molehills. With one of these mountains she shouted at and embarrassed me in front of the whole class and three teachers. I left school early that day to cry. In the afternoon she sent me a message saying ""everything cleared :)))"". Til this day I have not received an apology. I do not want this girl who has never been kind to me unless it pleased her at my wedding. 

I talked to a friend from class the other day about planning to not invite her and I was told it would be really unfair and asshole-ish, because it would show her and everyone else that I didn't want HER there specifically. I'm not really worried that she would get angry over not being invited. I'm worried that me not inviting her will break this ""tradition"" in which everyone from class gets invited to major life events. WIBTA for not inviting her anyway?

Edit: I'm very thankful for the input so far. What apparently didn't get through though is that I'm not asking if I'm TA for not inviting her. I'm perfectly aware that of course technically it's my right to invite to my wedding whoever I want, that I'm technically not the asshole. But that's not my issue. The issue I'm asking about is whether I'm TA for potentially ruining the tradition my classmates and I have going on.","1578006817.0","Not the A-hole","242","158"

"ej2u6s","1577993173","AITA for accidentally letting a group of girls run up a HUGE bar tab on NYE?","Alright, so I was at a club/bar that my friend is hostess/bartender at. That night she was working behind the bar but she had texted me that they had a small booth still not reserved and I could get it for cheap with bottle service. She's hooked me up like that before and I hopped on it. NYE, booth, bottle service. Surely a packed house, and I'll have a reserved seat. I was all over it. Not going to lie and as a single dude it's a nice little setup to talk to women that have mutual interest.

So, I'm mingling by the bar with this group of 3 girls who are all friends. We are having a decent enough conversation and they are talking about how they are all from out of town from California and one girl was from Willow Creek. At this point we literally say, ""the home of Bigfoot.""(I'm a bit of a conspiracy theory nut) After this we all laugh, and such then I jokingly say, ""that's it *ALL* drinks on me for Bigfoot's neighbors."" We all laugh and then I motion for my friend to come over then I buy a round of drinks on my tab.

After the drinks I moved back to my booth and didn't talk to them anymore. I did see they had met a group of three guys and they looked like they had joined up. But, more drinks. More fun. Countdown. All that jazz. Later in the night I'm talking to another woman in the booth. And, I can see the three girls darting straight towards me. 

Apparently, one of the girls had opened a tab and went to close out because they were leaving then got hit with something like a $1,200 bar tab. They were buying drinks all night thinking I was going to pay for it all and my friend was putting on their tab not mine. They wanted me to go up to the bar and explain the situation. I told them I wouldn't because that was obviously a joke that I would pay for all their drinks and I hadn't seen them all night and barely knew them there's no way I'm paying that.

They called me an asshole and all kinds of names I could barely believe. My favorite was the insulting of my wiener size. The woman I was sitting with left to get away from the drama and at this point security steps in telling them to chill out or get kicked out. They leave me alone and I sneak out when I'm ready to leave to avoid anymore drama with them.

But, I'm conflicted I really don't think I owed them anything but I guess in an alternate universe I can understand thinking they had a blank check... maybe? I don't know. Even with a blank check I would have gotten a few drinks. Not the bottles and so on they got.

So, AITA?

*Edit*: adding more detail from suggestions. They had bought a drink before I started talking to them from bartender friend. They must have came back to her for bottles after they left me. Then it got put on their card cause she obviously remembered them. This place gives you a host with the corkage fee. So, once you get a bottle you just alert your host and they keep the party going (mixers/glasses/chilling) along with the tab tallied.

Also, I didn't see their itemized bill but Ace of Spades champagne is carried at the bar and that's about 850 dollars just for a bottle. So, it might not have been 60 Long Island Ice Tea they bought.","1578025155.0","Everyone Sucks","2828","883"
"ej2veb","1577993308","AITA for whistleblowing on a company for underpaying staff?","I used to work at a small restaurant and bar. I was the Bar Manager. The payroll was done by the GM and sent to the owner to process. The assistant manager left due to conflicts with the GM and the hiring process was still happening. The GM was on holiday when payroll was due so she showed me how to fill everything out. It was a basic Excel sheet with formulas for hours x pay rate. I checked staff hours on the rota with their actual worked hours from the clocking in and out system. 
When a staff member clocked in or out on the till a receipt was printed. This was accessible via the software in the office. I checked through all FOH hours, all fine. I start to fill out the kitchen hours and saw that one of their totals to be paid was less than it should have been. He was in the same pay bracket as myself and worked similar hours, yet his pay was £200 less than mine. I checked I hadn’t made any mistakes as I didn’t want him to be underpaid for my mistake. Turns out, each Wednesday for the whole month he wasn’t being paid. The formula for the Wednesday box on his name had been deleted. I checked previous payrolls and it was the same. Their was no password protection on formula boxes so this issue could have easily been prevented. 

After noticing this, I fixed the formula and password protected it all, with the company password that was pretty much the same for everything. I sent it over to the owner with a note in the email about his pay being missing for however many months and if she could look into it. 

I went back to the bar and one of the girls asked if her hours were right as she thought she was being underpaid. I went back and checked her hours. If she had clocked in at 10:45am but didn’t actually begin her shift until 11am, she wouldn’t be paid until the official start time, which is fair as most staff get in early to have a smoke. I ignored those extra times already and had filled in the right clocking out times. She should have been getting about £350 for that month. She works the same amount of hours give or take each month but the last two months had only been getting £250. I checked over the past months payrolls and the GM had been lazy and just filling in rota times instead of clocking out times. She’d been getting underpaid a fair amount each month. I took some screenshots of the software that showed her clocking out times and sent them to her so she could  email the owner to query it. 

I get pulled into the office the next day by the owner asking why she’s getting emails from her staff with images of ‘her’ software that was confidential. I understand that part, but the staff can keep their clocking in and out sheets from the till for their own records, so it wasn’t like it was private information. I then get given my formal 4 weeks notice for gross misconduct apparently.

"ej2ypf","1577993708","AITA for the way I reacted to the idea of my daughter calling her stepfather Dad?"," My ex-wife and I have joint custody of our daughter Sarah, who is 9 years old. Sarah’s stepfather Steve has been in the picture for about 4 years now. 

So after she came home from spending the holidays at my ex-wife’s house, this is the conversation that Sarah and I had:  
Sarah: ""Steve told me that I can start calling him Dad if I want.""  
Me: ""What do you call him now? Just Steve, right?""  
Sarah: ""Yeah. But I guess I’d call him Dad and you Daddy, so it won’t be confusing.""  
Me: ""At least not until you’re too old to call me Daddy anymore.""  
Sarah: ""Heh, yeah, I guess.""  
She then went on telling me about other stuff that happened during the holidays, and she didn’t mention the Dad/Daddy thing again. I didn’t bring it up either so that was the extent of our conversation about it.

As I heard from my-ex wife, Sarah has since told Steve that she can’t call him Dad because it would be too confusing. My ex-wife thinks that this is my fault because I wasn’t supportive enough of the idea, and now Steve’s feelings are hurt because of my stupid male ego (her words). I told her that I wasn’t really supportive or unsupportive because Sarah and I barely discussed it, but she says that’s the same as being unsupportive and I should’ve gone out of my way to make sure that Sarah knew that I was okay with it. 

Honestly, I’ll admit that I’m not entirely thrilled about it, but I wasn’t trying to deliberately sabotage the idea or anything of the kind. Steve and I don’t know each other all that well but he seems like an okay guy and I don’t have a problem with him. If Sarah wants to call him Dad that’s her choice and I won’t try to discourage her, but I don’t agree that I should’ve been cheerleading the idea.

I also have a four hour a day commute.  (This is a given as I accepted the job with the commute, I am just adding this in to help show the amount of time each day I am taking out for work, which adds to my frustration)

This past week I have been required to work a significant amount of overtime.  My given schedule is 40 hours a week, Mon-Fri.  Since it was the holiday, I was supposed to be given holiday pay for 4 hours Tuesday and 8 hours on Wednesday and be able to stay home. 

Instead, these were the hours I physically was working.

Mon- 8hrs
Tues- 18 hrs (no holiday hours included)
Wed- 10.75 hrs  (no holiday hours included)
Thurs- 10.25 hrs (anticipating for today)
Fri- 4 hrs (supervisor is sending me home to comp 4 hours)
Sat- 0 
Sun- 6hrs (anticipated due to current schedule)

Last week I had some overtime (only 4.5) and took a sick day.  My supervisor is wanting me to, instead of using sick time, comp 8 hours of my overtime and comp the 4 hours tomorrow.

WIBTA to push for getting paid out the hours?  I already agreed to comp 4 of them, so I won't go back on that.  However, I feel like I should be getting paid for the rest of them and use sick time instead of comping the other 8.  

I also feel as though I should get some of the holiday hours for at least the Wednesday as I was supposed to have 8 hours PTO for New Years.  

I do not want to sound entitled or unprofessional, however I feel that I should be financially compensated for my time. So WIBTA?

Edit: For clarification, they're asking me to essentially take free vacation days in order to not have overtime.  If I work M- 16, T-16, W-8, then Th-0, F,-0.  When I enter my time its 40 and I have no overtime.  Not sure if this effects the answers about the legality of the company's practices.","1577995292.0","Not the A-hole","5","32"

The one before him was also abusive towards me and my mother. Don't know my real father. My stepfather was very controlling, used a lot of mental and physical tactics to get me to do what he wanted.

There were 2 instances of him making sexual advances towards me (only after I was 18 because he thought that would be a good age to bring it up? Idk his words), and I of course denied his advances. He made me promise not to tell me mother, which I did for the ""sake of the family"" or whatever. 

Well I ended up telling her one day a couple years later, and she said she'd talk to him. I knew he'd of course deny it and she believed him. I just brushed it off because I didn't want to deal with the emotional trauma of trying to hash that out again. 

Eventually I ended up moving out, moved to a different city and started my life. Tried to forget about everything. One Thanksgiving I went over to my parents and the Dallas Cowboys were playing. There's always been an unspoken rule that you don't bother him while a game is on, because he gets explosively annoyed. So I left him alone. He didn't bother to talk to me the entire time I was there, so I assumed he didn't want to speak to me.

Apparently he got super butt hurt about it and my mother messaged me asking why I ignored him.

I end up sending a long and nasty message, which I now regret, blaming my mother for the things that happened to me as a child (and that list is pretty extensive). It was a stupid message I should have never sent.

I played a lot as a kid but had to stop playing at Diamond/Pearl because I couldn’t afford the systems to play the more recent games. So naturally I became a huge fan of Pokémon Go when it was released and have become an active member of my local community. We communicate through Discord to do raids, trades, and events. I also bought a Nintendo Switch so I’ve been enjoying Pokémon Shield, although a lot of the game mechanics are new to me since I have not played a mainline game for years.

We have a guy in our group that is super active on the discord channel for the group. I learned after meeting him for the first time that he’s on the autism spectrum. I was looking for a shiny Rattata and he offered to trade me one, but when I met up with him to do the trade, he decided to evolve it to Raticate for an “evolve a Pokémon” quest, and I intended to keep it as a Rattata. When I vented to an admin about it, they scolded me for not knowing he was autistic and said I had to just accept that it happened. So despite being irked that I didn’t get what I was promised, I had to forgive him for it.

Well, he has a copy of Sword, and since I have Shield, he’s been pinging me constantly wanting Pokémon with specific stats for competitive teams and such. A lot of the things he’s asking for I’m not familiar with how to do since I’ve been away from the main games for a while, for example I realized I had gotten a Pokémon with something rare in the game called Pokérus and the guy badly wants me to trade him a Pokémon that has it. I had to research how to do that and spent a few hours trying to hatch an egg for him to no avail. I’m trying my best to do some of the things he wants but it’s starting to feel more like demands rather than requests. I just want to enjoy the game casually but I keep getting pinged by the guy because he wants me to do all this stuff for him.

I don’t really know what to do, especially because I’m an empath and I feel like when someone wants me to do something for them, I have no choice because it’ll make them happy. I go out of my way often for members of the community to help them with quests in Pokémon Go, as well as helping them with Meltan Boxes and other things. I also work between 50-60 hours a week so I don’t usually have the time to spend “grinding” for things in Shield, but with the requests I’ve been getting, I’ve been having to spend a lot of my free time hatching eggs for him.

AITA for not wanting to help him get his competitive Pokémon? I completely understand that being on the spectrum is difficult since I have a cousin and a good friend that are autistic, and being an empath myself, I feel like it’s my duty to make everyone happy. But at this point I’m just feeling overwhelmed with the amount of requests he’s wanted.

So we waited until around Christmas on a day we had my son to surprise them and pick the dog up.

They both ended up loving her and amazingly they were able to agree on a name. So we thought all was good until my ex called me earlier this week.

She was angry at me because I didn’t discuss with her about getting him a dog. Now her younger son is jealous his older brother has a dog and he doesn’t. Even though he loves dogs they can’t have one because my sons younger brother is allergic. 

Which is what caused this whole other issue because I guess my son didn’t say anything right away about the dog and he had a lot of dog dander on him and on his clothes. Which since they share a room made his brother sick for like a week until he admitted to his stepdad that we got a dog.

His stepdad who doesn’t really like me is now pissed that his son has been sick for a week because of me.

Obviously, I discovered that my gut feeling was correct, he was being unfaithful with me and speaking to people of all different genders. 

I’m not homophobic or trans-phobic by any means, it just hurts to know that he was speaking to lots of other people and lying to me about it. Telling me he loved me and wanted to marry me. We were making plans to buy a house, to have children together, for us to travel together and more. All the while he was cheating on me and lying to me about it. 

Before I found out, I even begged him to be honest with me and promised him we could work past it together, but he denied everything. I even spoke with my family about our struggles and issues. How we had been arguing for some time and that there was lots of distrust. 

My family genuinely believed that he was being faithful to me due to him advising that I speak with them and how he treated me. I will be honest; he did treat me extremely well and took care of me in every aspect of the word. None of that matters though if he was unfaithful to me and a liar.

I trusted him for some time before that gut feeling came creeping back and honestly I couldn't ignore it any longer I had to know the truth. 

I showed him my findings while we were out running errands, he had nothing to say. His exact words were *“You never stop do you?”*. When I got back to our apartment, he refused to be honest with me and give me details. All I know is that he was speaking to these people while I was asleep in the bed next to him or while we were both getting ready for church in the morning. Some of the people gave me details as to what websites he was using and verified that they were located near us. 

As I packed my things, I decided to keep the engagement ring, since he was the one who called off the wedding by cheating on me and failed to fulfill his promise to me. I believed and still do believe that I’m in the right with keeping the ring. 

He showed zero remorse for what he did and refused to take blame. Instead he spent time changing his passwords and deleting me off his social medias while I packed. Never once did he apologize to me or gave me any explanation. He didn't cry or beg me to forgive him.

When my family came to help me pack the remaining of my things the next day, he was still persistent about getting the ring back. As we left he said *""Happy New Year""* to us as we left in a sarcastic tone. Unfortunately, I did leave a lot of my things there due to how quickly I had to leave and how little room there was in the vehicle.  

I’ve spoken with my family about it and at first, they agreed but over time they advised that I give the ring back to him but keep the other gifts he gave me.","False","Not the A-hole","17","32"

I've recently decided to try and go vegetarian for a month for my new years resolution which has meant that I can't eat most of the things my family makes for dinner. So now they either have to make a few of the dishes meat free or I have to make my on food. 

My family has a problem with this and doesn't see the point if I'm only doing it for a month. AITA?

EDIT: I am more than willing to make my own food. I think their problem is from the fact that I'm only doing it for a month. The reason I'm doing it is because I just wanted to see if I could, if I can do the whole month and I don't hate it I am going to try and go for longer.

Some backstory: went to HS together. I found out from a mutual he’s had a crush on me since 10th grade.  We hung out platonically for a little while and then went on a date but things ended once I moved a state away. We reconnected once, didn’t work out, then reconnected again. only been intimate once, twice including the other night.

Woke up around 12 pm, still tired and half asleep. He offers to get us food and weed since he ran out. Rides w/ his roommates. He asked me what I wanted and said he wouldn’t be too long. He said his guy was only 20 away, so I assumed it would take no more than 1,1.5 hours. I didn’t want to be left alone but I also hadn’t showered and didn’t want to leave the house not feeling fresh. I used that time to shower, assuming he’d be back by the time I was done.

I was very wrong. After showering and being in and out of sleep, 5 hrs have now passed. 3 hrs ago he told me he was 30 min away so I was fuming. I started packing my things to leave. Contemplated it earlier but I was home alone with no key. Now idc. As I’m leaving I realized my phone is dead and I have a long way home so I stay to charge. I call him one last time. He finally answers, and says he’s about to walk through the door. 10 mins later he comes in, quickly apologizes and hands me cold food minus drink.

I told him after today to never speak to me again. 

20 mins pass and I’m alone in his room because he went to living room to play video games. He still hasn’t fully explained/apologized. I just blew up via text. 

He comes in the room to explain:
He said he took so long because the first guy wasn’t actually available, so they went to a second location 45 mins away. When I texted him about food, he allegedly WAS on the way back but his friend got called to make a deal 30 mins away. He also didn’t see my texts/calls because he fell asleep AND his phone died.

I told him it was all bullshit. None of what he said added up or made any sense, and that I felt extremely disrespected by how inconsiderate he was.

He countered by saying everything was out of his control. He understands why I’m upset but not why I’m THAT upset.

Phone finally charged so I called the Uber, said I was leaving and left. He didn’t say bye. He didn’t offer me a ride to the station or anything. Didn’t walk me out.

AITA for being upset? I really don’t think I am but I just found it alarming that he found so many convenient excuses for what happened and even said he doesn’t understand why I’m THAT upset.


TL;DR: Went over a guys house to smash, got left home alone for 5+ hours after multiple attempts to contact him w/ no response, so I angrily blew up on him. He says he fell asleep and his phone died and his ride is the reason it took so long. AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","10","50"

"ej45u9","1577998639","AITA for not performing and teaching for free?","I am a music student in college studying to become a music teacher. During the semester, I am  often hired to play my instrument by churches for around $50-$75 for a regular gig, and more for holidays. I grew up going to church that had a music director who does not pay musicians, but frequently emails asking me to play. I also had a friend growing up who attends that church, and is religious. There have been two instances now where she has called me greedy for not doing music things for free

The first time that this happened was in summer, where the friend asked if I would teach her my instrument for her college's marching band because it is less competitive than the instrument she plays. I said I would be happy to, and I would charge her less per lesson than other students I've taught. However, as soon as I mentioned that, her tone changed and she asked ""why would I pay you, we're friends?"" To this I explained that teaching someone an instrument takes time and skill, but that I would charge her less than my other students because we are friends. She told me that her neighbor, who also plays the same instrument would do it for free, so I ended the discussion by telling her to ask her neighbor then.

Recently, a couple of friends from high school, including her, met up for food and drinks, and overall it was a good time. She asked me if I was playing at the church for a special service, and I just said, ""no, the director isn't looking to pay the musicians."" Immediately, she raised her voice and started saying I was greedy and selfish for wanting to be paid to perform because it was the church I attended as a kid. I responded by saying that I do not go there anymore, and I owe the church absolutely nothing. I also mentioned how I never even asked for payment, I just wasn't going to do it. I also brought up that I dropped a couple thousand on a professional instrument, and that I want to be paid for my time and skills. She snapped back that I have absolutely no qualifications to be paid, which took me by surprise. I said in a sort of sarcastic tone, ""I guess the thousands of hours I've spent practicing and working with professional instructors really is meaningless, and the past few years that I've been hired by churches repeatedly were just me being unqualified."" The friend said she was done, and I said me too and took my coat and left.

Later, another person told me that I overreacted and at the end of the day, we are friends. But I don't really consider this person a friend anymore, because I'm offended that she would say I have no qualifications like I don't work hard and do well. She also has not seen me perform so I don't think it's fair of her to say I'm unqualified, and she wanted me to teach and perform with her until I said I wasn't doing it for free.

Weddings cancelled only a few months out. We were all sad. 

Now my sister is engaged to a new guy, J. J proposes a few days after they came to visit us.  Sister calls and asks how much we will give her to help with wedding. Parents respond that we gave her $7500 for the last wedding and never got any back. She says it all went towards deposits, her dad says she used it on her house, and mom thinks she used it on a boob job (she did get one we just don’t know how she paid for it). 

Now my sister is ignoring us. My mom didn’t even get to talk to her grandchildren on Christmas. I miss hearing from her.

"ej4aka","1577999170","AITA For being freaked out by my autistic neighbour?","So this boy is my next door neighbour. He only has a slight touch of autism and is really smart. He even got higher points than me in the leaving certificate. But he’s a bit socially awkward and his parents are in denial so he never got any help.

He started to become creepy with girls about 3 years ago when he took a liking towards my friend. She is so nice that she lets people walk all over her but if she rejected his advances he would start lightly banging his head off the wall (nothing aggressive just taps).
After a year and a half he moved onto another friend of mine similar personality, she would try to avoid him but still very friendly and nice. 

The third girl he liked though is when it really started to get concerning. Again super nice personality but she wasn’t afraid to stick up for herself. So he tried to talk to her and started following her around at school but once we finished secondary school and he didn’t see her on a daily basis he started tracking her location on snap maps! (he even showed up at my house unannounced one time she was there) he also walked an hour to where she works and waited outside till it got dark and when she realised he was there she started crying and her boss had to tell him to leave the premises.

But moving onto my experience, on NYE I was on a night out and was talking to a friend. He taps me and says happy new year! I say the same and continue talking to my friend but he keeps trying to get my attention, I tell him I’m talking to someone right now and he’s being rude. So my friend picks up a creepy vibe from him and says let’s just go. So we go to a different part of the club and after a bit I slip on a spilled drink but I don’t fall or anything and he emerges out of the crowd and asks my friend ‘IS SHE OKAY?!’ And my friend is like ‘are you following us?’ And he looks at me and storms off. Later that night I saw him in a corner banging his head like he used to.....

His bedroom window is positioned so if I’m at the kitchen table he can see me and often times when I’m eating alone I’ll look away from the tv out the window and he stares at me until I bring out my phone to record him, then he hides behind his curtains (I record him because it scares me and I want proof if something more serious happens) 

He’s been doing this for months now and I don’t know what to do. I’ve shown the videos to my friends and they all agree it’s really weird but my family always tell me I’m a horrible person for saying that he scares me and thinking someone with autism is creepy and I should be ashamed of myself.

So am I the asshole for being creeped out by him following/watching me?

Edit: when I say his parents are in denial I mean teachers have been telling them throughout primary and secondary school that he is autistic and his parents claim he’s not and any reports of his abnormal behaviour fall on deaf ears :(","1578002598.0","Not the A-hole","221","76"

So, my wife is home all day. I come home from work (I work mornings) and she's playing video games. I ask her if she wants to play something with me. She says ""sure, just let me knock out the chores real quick"",stops playing her game, and goes to doing chores. I'm sitting there shocked, because she was literally just playing video games, so I ask ""why didn't you do the chores before I came home?"" she says ""I didn't feel like doing them at the time"". 

That made me quite upset after hearing that, so I told her that made me feel like I am not important to her, and that I would never treat her like that. she said ""I didn't know it meant so much to you, you're overreacting"", and then I said ""cool, have fun, you can get all the chores done, cause I'm leaving"" and I left for a few hours. Am I crazy? Am I the jerk to react like this? I will admit that it was probably only 30 minutes of chores.

Tldr:wife had all day to do chores, decides to do them only when I ask her to spend time with me, I got upset and left.

Edit:I should add that we play games every day, and I did question her line of thinking, she said ""I wanted to do them so I wouldn't forget"" and that she was going to do the chores anyway when she stopped playing her game, it just so happens I was what caused her to stop playing her game.

Edit supercut!: I am seeing a lot of people saying that I should have helped with the chores if I wanted to spend time. That's not the point, I was just hurt that she mentioned the chores when she did, and did not even get my input. It made me feel like I was less important than chores, but her own game was more important, and I'd never make her feel that way, so I felt betrayed a little.

That said, I accept that I am the jerk, and I did overreact, thank you guys for the group humility exercise! P. S, we've been married three years, and have only had three arguments of this caliber.

1. Don't allow the dogs to jump up on you. They weight 65+ LBs so they can overwhelm small kids.
2. Don't encourage them to use their mouths on hands, use a toy if you want to play with them.
3. Don't rile them up or do things that would make them nervous. (Our younger one has some weird anxieties about older men that is normally not an issue)

Because we have these rules in place, our dogs have been happy and really good with people.

My dad visits once or twice a year. The last time he came in the summer was the first time he met my younger one, he disregarded all of my rules and constantly riled my dogs up, played with them with his hands, and had my younger one in particular jumping all over him.  After he left it took MONTHS of retraining to get my younger to stop jumping and being mouthy.

He is at my house again for Christmas and gets angry at me when I ask him to stop and makes passive aggressive comments about how he'll never give them any attention again.  Instead, he waits til I am not around and will push them around to get them to play with him, or make angry faces to intimidate them.  Its gotten to the point that my younger dog is sort of afraid of him and will randomly low growl/bark at him. Then my dad has the audacity to say, ""I don't know why he's acting like this!""  I have explained to him my rules and how I want my dogs treated and it feels like he thinks we don't let our dogs be dogs or that we are too strict with them. In a way, I agree. We are very strict because it allows us to do things we want with them. On the other hand, we tell will tell my dad he is more then welcome to play with them if he uses a toy, and to respect our rules.

Its to the point that he gets so offended that I just let him do whatever he wants and will deal with my dogs when he leaves.  Am I too strict with my dogs or too controlling with my father?  AITA?

Thank you all for your responses.  My dad left for the airport so we wont have any more issues for at least a few months.  I appreciate being told that I WBTA if I let him do his thing and will do my best to keep up my rules.

I (14M) live in the US, but am currently overseas for vacation, where most of my family lives. I am still in the foreign country.

My mom (42F) had me put a tracker app on my phone, because she wanted to make sure I was getting home safe. I was still using it overseas.

On Christmas Day, I was at my cousin’s (26M) house, and the topic was brought up. My uncle (51M) made fun of me, saying that I was being helicoptered. 

When we got to my grandmother’s house, he brought up the topic in front of the family, which had an argument about it. I could see my mom getting annoyed, and my uncle likes to take jokes and his jabs farther than they should. 

Fast Foward to yesterday, and everything is normal. Much of the family went to another country, so I go to stay with my uncle. 

I was packing up all my things, because I was going to Uber to his house, and he calls me. My phone is on 2% so I decline his call, and plug it in. I call back 5 minutes later and I say I’m sorry, and explain why I declined it, and he says bullshit.

He texts me later, wanting me to put a tracker on his phone, so he can see me while I’m on my way to his house. I tell him I can’t, and he says I’m deliberately lying. I said correct, because I didn’t want to be tracked.

Problem is, an app is what was used. I would have to have him download the app, create an account, and add me on the app to have him track me. 

I order the Uber, get in, have a talk with the driver on the way there, and didn’t check my phone the entire ride, until I get to the gate of his complex. I check my phone, and he asked where I was, twice, and then he says he won’t talk to me anymore. 

I get there, I get my stuff, and I say hello to him, and he gets angry, says I was disobeying him, and not listening to what he was asking. He says he won’t have me in his house anymore, and I’m dead to him. 

So I pack up my stuff that I had at his house, and he calls me an Uber to go back. He calls my mom, who left back to the US, and they argue. He says I’m a bad kid, I need to be taught respect, and he hangs up on her.

He calls me an Uber, and tells me to get out of his house, and I wait out on the street. I get back, and I stay at my grandmother’s house, who is leaving the next day. 

His argument is that I didn’t do what he told me to, I deliberately declined his calls, which I did, and explained to him why, he says I hate this country, referencing to a conversation I had with him before that I will explain. 

The conversation that he was talking about was one where I told him I am a little homesick, and wished I got a plane ticket that left earlier. He took what I said, and exaggerated it. 

I talk with my mom, and she thinks I should apologize to him. 

I don’t feel like apologizing. I don’t think I did anything wrong, and I believe he’s overreacting.

Last term he threw a christmas party in our shared kitchen on a Friday night: he specifically told the rest of his flatmates (7 of us) that we specifically couldn't attend or be in our own kitchen that evening, as it was for his friends only. Unimpressed, we chose to put up with it, but made it obvious to him that we also planned to have a Christmas Dinner in the same kitchen the next day. He promised it'd be cleaned up in time, no questions asked.

Cut forward to 1pm the day after his party. We'd made it clear to him that we wanted to begin prepping our dinner at 2pm (and we invited him!), but I enter the kitchen to find it in an absolute disgrace. Baking trays (including my own!) full of now-hardened grease, a tray of remaining stuffing and sprouts left out for 18+ hours, drinks open and sat everywhere, you name it.

Me and two others decided enough was enough, and got about to cleaning it up. We weren't going to let him ruin our own Christmas Dinner. We're halfway through washing up and cleaning all his mess (1:30pm), when he comes in claiming to have just woken up, and saying he was just about to clean it all himself. I grew quite agitated, and told him, ""I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough. You either wake up to clean it on time as you promised, or you do it after the party with all your friends."" 

He stormed out, muttering about how unfair we were being, as we washed up his plates and swept up his crumbs. It felt like a major slap in the face. He didn't come back to actually help, as he said he would. I can definitely see why he'd feel cornered, and perhaps I shouldn't have been so short with him when he'd come in to try and clean it (albeit a little late).

My other flatmates told me I'd stayed civil and not to worry about it, but later the next day, I check my phone to see him & his friends had put me on blast in a large group chat for our apartment block. 80+ people, all stating that we were out of order. He claimed in there that we were rude and treated him like a child, and that we were ""bullying him out of the university"". Moreover, he called me out by name to 80+ people for ""throwing away all his leftovers"", when my other flatmates can attest to the fact that what we threw out was probably a single portion of cold, sad stuffing and sprouts. I felt sick to my stomach seeing all these people call me a bitch, etc, etc.

I even extended my apologies for the food in the following few days, but he called it ""petty bullshit"" and stormed out. I can understand why us binning the food may have pissed him off, but this all feels unreasonable.

My coworker decided to be rude and say something incredibly bitchy. She said, “if you’re so depressed, why don’t you find another job? All you do is complain.”

Took place on NYE, my store stayed open until regular closing time, 11pm. I have a thirty minute drive home and I wanted to get to the NYE party my roommate was throwing and see the fireworks display.

I got a call at ten-thirty on the store phone from a gentleman asking what time we close. I tell him eleven. We're the only location of our particular store in the area and it's a big area. Guy says he's on his way, be there between half an hour and forty five minutes. I remind him what time we close and if he isnt in the store by 1059pm I'm locking up. 

Anyway, I get ten minutes till close, I've done all my closing tasks just waiting for 1100pm so I can shut everything down. The guy still hasn't shown up. I go around and block and face everything, make sure the place is clean. I turn the lights off and as I'm fixing to lock the door I see this guy running across the lot towards our store waving.

Fortunately for me the windows have incredibly tinted glass on the outside so he may have seen my figure but he couldnt tell if I saw him and the large columns supporting the roof of the covered walkway outside were slightly obstructing me.

It was 1100pm by my watch so I locked the door, grabbed my gear, and left. I could hear him knocking on the front door. Nothing we sell is emergent, we sell vitamins and lotions and stuff like that, nothing we sell is medicine or life saving material so I know he didnt die or anything.

I mentioned that I bought one of those service dog vests online so that I can bring my dog on the subway.  (Dogs are otherwise disallowed) 

Fast forward a week later and   I’m called into a meeting with HR and another coworker. Apparently my comment about using a service dog vest was offensive and I’m no longer able to bring my dog to work.

"ej4xh0","1578001830","AITA for feeling resentful around my in-laws?","Throwaway account. 

So, little bit of a back story: DH and I have been together 5 years. He’s first generation Italian, and his family comes to visit 2-3 times a year ... and when I say family, there’s usually 5-10 people. The older generation (his mom and aunts/uncles/grandparents) speaks broken English but mainly Italian. The younger generation (DH, his siblings, cousins, etc) all grew up speaking English in public and Italian at home with the family. 

Every get together we’ve ever had I find myself feeling incredibly lonely, somewhat resentful, and occasionally completely outcasted in my own home. My children and I aren’t fluent in Italian. I have been trying to learn, I pay for a tutor, have tons of kids learning app games in Italian, and I have the Babel app. I have asked DH to listen or to have conversations with me in his native language, but he flat out refuses saying it’s not his place to teach me. But I just want to practice, to learn his slang and accent, and be able to put them in coherent sentences. 

I know enough to pick up some words here and there to follow along, but that’s about it. This leads to me just sitting by the wayside when we have family gatherings, only to be accused of being antisocial. I would never ask them to just stick to English for my sake, I just wish the DH would make an effort to give me some visual cues, the occasional TLDR of conversations, or even just not get frustrated with me because I can’t join in.

I'm a M(30s). This particular group of friends are historically close friends I've had since we were in high school (20+ years).  I have a kid who is 3 years old and a 4 month old. Some made an effort to visit after the first baby, but those that did probably only came by once over the next few years. Now after the second baby, only a few have come by to visit. Most haven't bothered to even try. The only acknowledgement really was a congratulations message from most of them in our group chat right after we had the baby.

Since having our first, I don't see them as much anymore (naturally). Especially the one's that don't have kids (most of them). We're mostly just in touch via the group chat nowadays, with the occasional social event every few months or so.

This is in stark contrast to my wife's friends, who have all been over (and bearing gifts too). None of them needed an invite. They just called or messaged asking when was the best time for us, and arrived promptly. I've mentioned in passing/indirectly to my friends that they're welcome to come visit without trying to be pushy about it, but they didn't seem to take it seriously.

What is my obligation here, if any?  It's been almost 5 months. I've had pretty disparaging thoughts about them and have openly talked with my wife about how self-centered they all are, and how after 20+ years, that these relationships are either coming to an end or that they're just fake friends at this point. I know it's common for your social life to drop off after having kids, but shouldn't your friends be obligated to make *some* effort? I don't want to explicitly invite them over at this point, because their absence has made it pretty clear that they just don't care to.","1578003570.0","Asshole","21","31"

Her mom was supposed to pick her up on Wednesday night. She verified those plans at LEAST twice. So I arranged for my sister to pick up my son on Thursday after his morning practice so they could spend a couple days together and have fun. 

My boyfriend texted me Wednesday night (I was visiting my grandmother) that his daughter wasn’t getting picked up until Thursday night now. 

I told him he’d have to find a babysitter for his daughter since my son had practice and then was leaving with my sister in the morning. 
(His daughter couldn’t go with my sister as she lives out of town and her mom wanted to pick her and can’t be trusted to sit quietly through 1 1/2 hours of basketball practice). 

Basically we text fought, he said my son needed to cancel his plans to watch his daughter, I said no, he said if I left his daughter home alone he’d call the cops. Blah blah blah. 

I told him I was putting my foot down this time and not changing my son’s/sisters plans. This was between him and his ex since the ex chose to not pick up the girl. I told him to find a babysitter and it would be fine. And then he didn’t text me anymore. 

This morning (Thursday) my boyfriend texts me pissed since his daughter called and said she was home alone because my son went to practice like he was supposed to. (I had told him to go to practice last night). 

I said “Well yeah she probably is alone if you didn’t find her a babysitter.” And I got told I was fucked up in the head. 


But am I though? He expected me to rearrange my sons schedule and/or find a babysitter for his daughter and didn’t put any effort into finding a babysitter on his own. 

TL;DR : my boyfriend thinks I’m an asshole because his daughter got left home alone since he didn’t find a babysitter so his daughter after I told him repeatedly my son couldn’t watch her?


***EDIT: Boyfriend went home at lunch and took rest of day off to watch her. (I go home at lunch everyday to check on kids).

"ej5cha","1578003566","AITA for leaving my apartment a mess when I moved out?"," I (21F) graduated college last month. For my last semester, I rented a student apartment with two girls(20-21F). I didn’t know either of them, but they knew each other.

Our first night we all got together to have a roommate meeting so we could discuss each other’s schedules and habits. We all mentioned we were a little disorganized and messy, but that the mess was always just clothes and books, never food or garbage or anything gross. We agreed to keep our messes in our own rooms and that we would keep the common area (living room, kitchen) clean for each other and any potential guests.

It soon became apparent that these two had never cleaned up after themselves. They constantly had dishes in the sink and food sitting out around the kitchen for weeks at a time. They never took out the trash and would just find somewhere else to put it if it started to overflow. Eventually I started doing their dishes and cleaning just so the apartment would stop smelling weird. I tried not to make it a habit because I didn’t want to teach them that they could leave a mess and it would magically be cleaned up, but I could only take so much. I tried bringing it up to them and asking them to clean up after themselves several times, but was ignored.

October rolled around, and I was set to graduate and move out in December when my lease ended. They had another semester in the apartment before their leases were up in May. I decided that their messes were no longer my problem since I was leaving, so I stopped cleaning anything that wasn’t my room or bathroom.

The apartment went to shit. Dishes, food, and trash everywhere, and this weird smell just would not go away no matter what. It was a absolutely disgusting so I spent nearly all of my time in my room whenever I was in the apartment. My family came to move me out and they were disgusted as well, but they sided with me that it’s not my mess so it’s not my problem, especially since I had been ignored after asking my roommates to clean up.

I sent the complex an email since I knew they would do move out inspections explaining the state of the common area and how I was not responsible for it, but did clean my room and bathroom. I got my move-out statement while at home with no cleaning charges or anything, so I was officially done.

Then I got a bunch of texts from the other girls in the apartment calling me all kinds of names and talking about how it was unfair that I’d left everything such a mess when I’d cleaned up the apartment in the past. Apparently, since the complex did a move out inspection for me, they had found the disaster the other girls had made of the common area. I guess it was so bad they got hit with some hefty cleaning fees over break and were being threatened with eviction if they don’t take better care of the place. They say it’s my fault and I do kind of feel bad. I thought they had until May to clean up, but I guess not.

My wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I’ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We’re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. 

The next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an “announcement” to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, “Nope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It’s my day. Thank you for understanding.” and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn’t happen. 

Flash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fiancé announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! 

I’m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It’s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I’m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited.

My parents are upper-middle-class and we've only struggled with wealth when I was younger. Ever since last year (maybe even before but I can't remember) my parents have struggled to provide a healthy, reliable source of food for me reaching a low point in freshman year when I almost developed an eating disorder because of our awful fast food habits, lack of lunches and so on. After that, for the next few months, my parents improved the situation by getting a slow cooker in which they only made soup and different kinds of pasta but still a markup!

In the springtime, I started pushing them to branch out and they did which I was so happy about but now they are climbing back into their shell of soup and bread. Today I went downstairs to ask my parents what we had in the house, old leftovers, bread, cereal, and ham. We go on shopping trips AT LEAST three times a week and we don't have any food in the house, why? because we don't buy anything unless it's for soda and junk food. This is the 12th day we haven't had any lunch/ had pretty much only soup dinners and I feel like it's not that hard to have food in the house to provide to your child; The shittiest part of all of this is we go through this cycle at least every two months where I snap and lash out at them and then they work on it by trying to get foods and them slowly declining in willingness to have meals.

3 year ago my fiance and I (basically my husband, we've been together 13 years) moved out of state and to a completely new area for his job and career. A few months into being here I met a nice girl who I became friends with. She is about 8 years younger with an 8 year old son (I'm CF). Kid isn't bad, I don't mind him, he's pretty self sufficient. Anyways, I've watched him a few times here and there when her babysitter flaked and I didn't have anything to do. This was during the day, while I was unemployed.

Cut to a year later, and she is moving to the City I currently live in, but her job has switched her to 12-Hour night shifts. 

I get a random text one day, after not being able to get ahold of her, asking if my Fiance and I wouldn't mind taking her son while she goes to work at night.

MEANING, at least 5 or more nights a week, he would be with us from 6 at night to almost 8 in the morning. 

For FREE.

Why not just let him move in at that point? That means that while my Fiance and I both work days, we would get NO personal time. All the hours we work to live in a home we own, with no roommates, after years of renting, would be for nothing. 

I simply responded with a simple text saying that was a matter that should be discussed face to face and not through a text message - to which I got no response. For MONTHS.

I had already ordered my food and was waiting with my GF (22F) when we heard yelling to our right.

An angry woman (about 40-50F) was yelling at the cashier because, as usual, the ice-cream machine was broken, and her child (about 3-4M) was throwing a tantrum about it.

They're clearly understaffed and there's a very long line behind you, so just get something else or leave.""

The woman immediately retorted ""I don't know who you think you are, but I have serious anger issues and find it hard to control myself. How dare you try to police my behaviour!""

""Anger issues is no exc-"" I began.

""You are discriminating against me!"" yelled the woman, and everyone in the restaurant turned to look.

Long story short, him and his wife were out of town on vacation and they decided to visit a bar in the town. My friend decided to get him a scotch instead of his normal order of beer and he takes his scotch on the rocks with one singular ice cube. He requests it this way because the ice will water down the scotch and nobody likes that. So he requested it, and the bartender comes back with his scotch neat with no ice and a soda glass full of ice and tells him that he can just add the ice himself and walks off. He didn't think that he made an unreasonable request but the way she responded made him wonder if he was the asshole here.","False","No A-holes here","7","30"
"ej6coz","1578007888","AITA for snapping at my coworker after he falsely accused me of being a bully?","I work in a large (around 125 people) office. I have a group of like 15 people who I talk to and will usually eat lunch with a few of them. We occasionally do happy hours. 

I had emailed the 15 people to arrange a happy hour on the friday before christmas on December 20th. I’ve done this before and added a little line at the end to feel free to invite anyone they want. This is a very casual thing. We already did a formal office christmas party earlier in December. 

Anyway, the happy hour itself was fun but on Monday before Christmas, my coworker “Alan” came up to me and said “I have to confront you about something.” Alan does not work in my department, we’ve interacted a few times and I find him a generally unpleasant person to be around. He monopolizes conversations and is always trying to make “edgy” jokes that just come off weird and annoying. Honestly, I don’t fucking like him but I’ve never been anything but polite to him. I would never invite him anywhere but it’s not like I would leave the bar if he came to happy hour. 

So he tells me that he heard about the happy hour and asks why I didn’t invite him. I apologized (which I now regret) and told him I would invite him next time. I thought that was the end of it but it wasnt. 

This Monday, my coworker/friend Bob told me that Alan was still bitching to anyone who would listen about this stupid fucking happy hour and complaining about how “cliquey” the office is. I’m sorry but I feel like I am under no obligation to invite the entire office out if I just want a few drinks. Bob also apologized for not including him and Alan said that he didn’t blame him and that he knew it was just me being a bully. This obviously pissed me off.

Today, Bob, a few other of my friends, were in the lunch room eating lunch. Alan comes in with his food and immediately sees me and “jokingly” says, “Hey “Cathy”, Is it alright if I sit here? I know I didn’t receive a written invitation.”

So I kind of lose my head and snap, “This kind of shit is exactly why we don’t invite you anywhere.” I can’t lie, I was HEATED. He looked a bit shocked and walked out with his lunch. I immediately felt bad about it but my friends all reassured me that he was an asshole and deserved it. But they’re my friends so of course, they’d say that.

"ej6cyz","1578007920","AITA for not wanting to invite extra people to my wedding for my mother less than 3 weeks before?","Here’s some backstory. Skip to bottom for TLDR.

Lived w/my parents well into my 20s. Mom is, to put it mildly, verbally/emotionally abusive. Criticized my weight all my life, put me on Slimfast in middle school. The rest of my family is not much better. Grandma will occasionally join Mom in picking on me, Dad is the best one but he doesn’t stop Mom.

Late 20s, I talked about moving out, next door house was for sale, so they convinced me to buy the house w/Bro. Went in on it 50/50, he made a bunch of decisions w/out me. Mom helped him take $10k from my account to redo the kitchen. When I lost my job he said I should still be paying half the bills after he basically stole my savings. Moved his fiancé in w/out asking my approval – would've given if asked – she was horrible to me. IE: trying to get him to kick me out of our house. Bros fiancé paid for nothing (Bro wanted me to pay for her part of the bills). They've broken up & he has since apologized. Mom would come in w/out my consent. She tried to control how I laid out my furniture & yelled @ my BFF for helping me move things around for my comfort. Had a party, she was in/out all night. She watched for my car @ night, called incessantly when I wasn’t home early.

Around 30, I fell in love. It took me a LONG time to introduce him to them because I was terrified they would drive him off. But he’s REALLY great. He doesn’t like the way they treat me, but has always been cordial. Since he proposed: Mom said he should be controlling my weight, insulted his family. Dad said that Fiancé cursed @ him – which is ridiculous because he has a lot of patience; BFF jokes he’s a mountain that might be hiding a volcano that doesn't work – so if he did blow up it would be for a really good reason. So, dad lied & he didn’t understand why I was angry about the lie. I apologize to them for stupid reasons but they refuse to apologize for anything. Changed my dress 3 times to please Mom & Grandma, broke down crying in David’s Bridal because of how they acted there about my size, after they got me to take them to find dress #4. 

Moved in w/Fiancé when I got a job in his area, Mom & Bro decided to redo all the floors in the house. Hadn’t moved everything yet, asked for my rooms to be last. They lied & said ok, then had all my stuff moved out of my rooms into the living room, where HIS pets chewed/peed/pooped on my stuff. It was a mess, stuff was broken, & nothing was put back right.

**TLDR:** My family has controlled everything in my life, abused me all this time, & are pissed because I'm moving out to live w/the man I'm about to marry.

**Now:** Wedding is this month. Mom wants me to invite more of her friends. Bro says she needs more people to talk to @ the wedding. I've already invited multiple extended family members I didn't need to & 4 of her best friends but she says that's not enough. AITA for wanting to say no?

My mother did not have enough money for his admission fees, books, etc, so she asked me to lend her 3 grand for one month. I am not super well off, but I did have 3 and a half grand in savings, saving for a vacation at the end of the year, so I said ""Only a month? Sure"" and loaned her the cash.

One month later, I ask my mother about the loan, and she says ""I can't pay you back yet, If I pay you back, I would not be able to afford the electric bill."" So I asked ""Ok, when can you pay me back?"", and she said ""two more weeks"". I say alright, and we're good.

Two weeks comes up, she says ""If I pay you back, it'd leave me with 100 dollars in my bank, groceries may be tight."" At this point, I have had enough, I say ""It's been a good chunk of time over what you said, can you pay me back SOMETHING?"" At this point, she got quite upset, and told me that ""Family does not strong arm family"", that I'm a jerk for ""pressuring her"". I did feel bad about it, but I wanted to make sure I would EVENTUALLY get paid back, not following endless IOU's. 

Anyone else with a similar experience? If I was not expecting the money back ever, I would have never loaned any.

Am I a jerk? Should I just have had good faith? 

After she calmed down, She did pay me back in partials, 1 grand a month over three months.

Also, if anyone is worried/concerned, this didn't destroy our family/relationship or anything, I had her to my house for Christmas, and she told me I'm the best child ever. (This is AFTER she paid me back)...I just know not to loan a large sum of money again. ;)","False","Not the A-hole","12","24"

"ej6rus","1578009690","AITA for NEVER being around this dog??","My sister has a dog that, I think, is objectively dangerous - she has attacked everyone in our family/friend group, including my sister. I am therefore slightly afraid of this dog, obviously. My sister refuses to put the dog down, despite everyone (my parents, sister, her boyfriend) telling her she needs to do so before someone gets seriously hurt/my sister gets sued. 


So I've told my sister that I will NOT walk/feed/care for the dog in any way. Part of this is because I am a little wary of the dog. But the dog, I admit, is normal maybe 95% of the time. So a good part of the reason I've said this is so my sister, at some point, may be forced to put the dog down (say, when she has to go out of town and no one will watch the dog). There are obviously a limited number of people who can help out with this dog, as the dog freaks out around strangers. So is this a shitty thing to do, given my motivation? AITA?

Edit, in response to posts: We've had other pets and have definitely tried training and working with this one, this is NOT just us wanting to throw away a dog's life because we're too lazy or inexperienced to train. Trainers think the dog (a rescue) just can't overcome past abuse/trauma.

So I’m staying in an Airbnb that was already disappointing to begin with (not very clean, a lot of people in this small apartment with one bathroom for host, family who has been staying with him, and guests) but I’m a firm believe that things could always be worse. What makes me want to leave a bad review though was that New Year’s Eve night, my friend and I got back to the Airbnb around 2:30-3ish and we were trying to go to sleep when our host comes back at 4-4:30 with some friends, one of whom his brother and law who’s been here staying with the host the entire time we have been here. When the get here the brother in law opens our door twice to see if we are sleep, but I’m still awake in bed on my phone my friend is asleep and we make eye contact when he opens it so he knows I’m awake and then he closed the door. Like five minutes later they start blaring music and are signing along very loudly with it. This continues until literally 8:45 in the morning. My friend wakes up not long after and we get literally no sleep all night. Now I know it was New Years and I’m trying to be cool but until nearly 9am????? Especially when you are running an Airbnb and KNOW you have guests there???? I just want to know if I’m really justified in leaving a complaint about the loud music and everything even tho it was New Years. Thanks folks.

TLDR: Airbnb host and friends blasting music and loudly signing until nearly 9am. My friend and I get literally no sleep. Should I leave a bad review or would it be lame to complain cause was New Years?

"ej6sdj","1578009751","AITA for being angry when my husband is late picking me up from work?","Short backstory: I can't drive, unfortunately. I got a migraine with vision loss in driver's training, and my instructor reported it to the state. The DMV gave me a permanent ban on getting a license--ridiculous, I know--so I've never owned a car or anything.

*EDIT* because it's popping up in the comments: Yes, that really did happen, yes, medical bans from driving do exist. A quick Google search would tell you as much. I am willing to drive. It's bureaucratic bullshit that's stopping me.

Anyway, because of this, I've always had to rely on others for transportation. Enter my husband.

My husband takes me to and from work every day. I really am grateful for that... I know it blows to basically double commute. But lately... he's been forgetting me. Or being late. Not 5 minutes late, but 20+ minutes late. Today he texted me apologetically and told me I should probably just get a Lyft because he was still getting ready for his shift (I work 8-5, he works 6-11). There have been other days where he fell asleep or got absorbed in something, and he didn't show up at all. Phone calls went unanswered. I then panicked, unsure what to do because I didn't want to get a ride home if he was already en route, but time was vanishing while I waited. I've yelled at him each time this has happened, even though I regret it later. It just pisses me off so much.
 
I'm the youngest person in my workplace and I struggle to get respect. When my husband is late & I end up awkwardly hanging around the workplace, I cringe every time someone asks me ""aren't you going home?"". I don't want everyone to know I can't drive and judge me because of it. I can't work while I wait because that would put me in overtime. If I could keep working until he arrived, I probably wouldn't give much of a shit. But that's not possible. So I just... sit. Pointlessly.

To me, it feels like I'm not asking too much that he come get me on time. But maybe I might be the one being a jerkass here because in the end, my husband is being taxi driver for me every single day. And not just to work, but to the store and everywhere else. A part of me thinks, ""this is your norm, he signed up for this, so you shouldn't feel guilty"", but another part of me thinks, ""your needs are a huge amount of work and you should be happy he even tries"". AITA?

EDIT 2: I think the consensus is that I'm the asshole here. My husband read back over this with me and insists that while I don't ""completely suck"", he agrees that me getting mad at him over this is really shitty. He doesn't do Reddit, but he was very smug about ""winning"". I think that's fair. We're gonna look more into trying to fight the driving ban again, and in the meantime, I'm gonna try to fit more Lyft into my budget to give the man a break.

"ej6tvo","1578009939","AITA for not following my wife quickly and closely just because she said ""come""?","I'm typing this out on mobile.

This morning, my wife heard a sound and looked out the window, she started saying ""I saw a woman carrying... Nevermind, come"" and started walking to our front door at a normal pace while motioning for me to follow her, so i did. I asked her what's going on, and she just gave me the ""wait"" motion with her hands.

She went out the front door while i waited for further instructions at the landing. At this point i still had no idea what she saw and what she wanted from me. She said ""come! Why are you standing there?"" so I walked to the entrance and stood there to await further instructions. She just went outside, looked around, got our mail, and came back in.

She was annoyed and asked me why I was waiting at the landing instead of following her more closely, and why I took a couple of seconds to start following her instead of immediately. I said I didnt know what was going on because she didn't tell me, I just woke up, and her interrupting herself also threw me off. Apparently she saw a woman walking away from our front gate carrying a parcel, and she was thinking maybe it was parcel theft. The sound she heard was the sound of our front gate being closed (she's more familiar with that sound because she doesnt work and stays home normally, I'm just on a break from work). She wanted me to follow her for safety. Fair enough, I said, but there was no way for me to know that because she did not communicate all that to me, and her body language/movements also did not convey any sense of urgency at all.

She got angry and said next time she tells me to ""come"" i should just drop everything immediately and follow her closely wherever she was going, and i should have done that this time. I got defensive said if i knew what was happening, I would, but she did not tell me what was happening or what she was trying to do, and her body language did not convey any sense of urgency, so I did not act like there was an emergency. If she wants me to do what she described, she needs to communicate the situation to me or at least act accordingly herself so that I can read it from her actions, and that I am not agreeing to be at her beck and call without any question because I'm not her dog.

On top of that I have other illnesses that generally make my life very hard. Couple with depression and some other mental health problems and my days are not easy. 

I joke alot about my impending doom and my everyday struggles, it's kind of my coping mechanism. Life has not been kind to me in alot of ways but in many ways it has. I don't want people to think I am ungrateful but my coping mechanism has always been I'd rather laugh than cry. 

I've had people tell me I shouldn't joke about it and other people think it's a good out look to be able to laugh about it. I honestly don't know anymore. I know I probably joke about it too much and it probably gets old but idk what else to do. 

What got me thinking about this is recently a friend has told me that I shouldnt think about my death so much and joke about it. That it negatively effects me . I've had other people say I shouldn't joke about things like this. My family gets really upset when I bring it up and so does my girlfriend. It effects me everyday so I don't know how to ignore it.

I parked the car on the street in front of my parents’ house around 8 p.m. and went inside. At some point during the night, somebody hit the car and drove away, because when I went outside for a run the next morning, I saw that part of the rear bumper was damaged and there were white scrape marks along the left side. There was no note. My parents and I knocked on a few of the neighbors’ doors to see if anybody had witnessed the hit and run and could give us some more details about the other vehicle, but unfortunately nobody said they had heard or seen anything. 

I contacted Ben right away and let him know what had happened so he could file a claim with his insurance. We took the car in to a body shop this morning, and they gave us a quote of a little over $1,200 to repair everything. Ben’s insurance should cover the majority of it, but there is still a $500 deductible that he has to pay out of pocket.

So here’s the problem: Ben thinks that I should be the one to pay the deductible because I was the last person to drive the car and parked it in the spot where it got hit. I said there’s no way I’m going to pay $500 for damage caused by a hit-and-run. If I had caused an at-fault accident, I would absolutely pay up, no question. But the car was parked. I was not driving it. I understand that having to pay the deductible sucks, but it’s his car, and I think it’s his responsibility to cover the cost.

At this point I feel like he’s just calling me a liar. On top of that, I really hate anything to do with doctors and needles (was hurt traumatically at a doctors office.. and he later threatened me with “a few extra shots” in front of my parents. I had nightmares for years regarding needles and hospitals.) and I’ve made him aware of why but he keeps saying it’s something I “need” to do for him. 

I’ve even told him that sex isn’t even on my mind or on the table as a possibility with him. He literally only laughed and then kept giving me reasons I should do it anyways (yet still didn’t offer to pay for it...)

When I asked Emily to define “dating” through the computer, and how she could say that she “loved” someone whom she had never met, I was met with hostility and told that I was not a good friend because I wasn’t being supportive. When I raised the fact that Emily was being hypocritical, by saying that my relationship wasn’t real, then deciding she was in love with someone over the Internet, I was met with more hostility. She stated that she only said those things because she was in denial. I believe that denial is a real thing, but I don’t see how it would apply here. There was no situation that had happened in her life that would cause her to feel denial here. 

I was joined in this questioning by another close friend, whom was also criticized for being in a relationship. Emily said that,”If you guys pull some shit like this again, I’m gone”. We were not aggressive when talking to her about this, we did however bring up things that showed that she was being a hypocrite. AITA?

"ej71aa","1578010862","AITA for not babysitting for free?","Ok so some backstory, my parents divorces years ago and my mum now has a bf (let's call him Adam) and he has 3 kinds, 2 of them are great and around my age (one's 17 and the other is 15, I'm 16), but the youngest (10) is the one I've got the problem with. He's spoiled and entitled and I dont really like him that much, but out of my family (mum, older sister (in uni), older brother (full time job)) I'm home more often bc I stay home unless I'm in college, and so whenever it's the Adam's time to have the kind (wednesdays and weekends) then he will often go out with my mum on dates and stuff, just leaving him with me, without me realizing. So I'll just be in my room and go downstairs to get a snack and he'll be sat watching tv, or playing games, etc.

And so, I've started letting him do whatever (as long as he doesn't burn the house down or die) and not looking after him when he's here, so I havent (really) cooked for him or made a point of staying home if I had plans already, does this make me the asshile for not watching someone else's kid for free, without my prior knowledge?

Edit: I really don't leave my house that much as I don't make plans with friends very often due to personal issues, so it's not like I'm leaving him home alone for hours on end every time he's round.","1578015649.0","Not the A-hole","9","35"

Since it was the holidays, and a local woman I knew I gave her a huge discount, offered a warranty, and started the same day she requested the job. I charged her $450 for the whole project, and had her buy all the materials out of pocket so I wouldn’t have to add a percentage for me buying materials. 
Now, I had no intention on staining these stairs, and told her that from the very beginning. Wood planks need to be weather treated before being stained (depending on the wood you get, but I do it for all lumber of any kind if I’m building outside to be safe) and I was not interested in waiting then coming back to stain to get my check. She was 100% okay with this and insured me that either her husband or son would stain the stairs. 
So on the last day of the project I was only there to collect all my tools + materials and do some durability tests on the stairs. Everything checked out. As I go into the house to collect the check she tells me that she would like me to stain them today. I told her that would not be possible, because of the reason above. She informed me that she didnt care, and wants them done now. She was scrolling through Facebook or whatever mid conversation, and I tell her If she finds the stain she wants I’ll pick it up today and do the stain, but the warranty will not include any damage to the stain as she told me to do them regardless of the treatment they needed. I also made it very clear that it would be an extra $100 for last minute notice, she gave me the ‘yeah yeah whatever that’s fine’ and as I’m on the way to the store texts me the stain that she wants. (Note that she is also responsible for reimbursing me for the stain and whatever brushes and materials I needed, no added fee’s just exactly what’s on the receipt.) 
Long story short I get back stain the stairs and by the time I’m done it is freezing cold and dark as hell. I go in, exhausted to collect the check, which at this point is around $625. She does not react well. Interrogating me trying to figure out where the ‘hidden fee’s’ come from, why I’m trying to scam her, blah blah blah. She writes the check for $500 even. She tells me she will not pay a cent more. At this point I’m holding my composure, as I always do with clients. I tell her if she does not give me the rest that I will take her to court to receive the remaining amount. She refuses, I leave and start calling attorneys and building a case, annoying but whatever. 
So Reddit, I really just want to know if I’m the asshole for the $100 fee for short notice, and if I’m the asshole for taking the woman to court for a petty $125. I don’t necessarily need the money, but I guess I can see how it would be petty and/or unnecessary like the woman claims.

Edit in case anyone cares:

Gosh mommy and daddy’s house is nice” or “daddy got promoted today, he’s the smartest guy in the world”. If it were just for photo sharing purposes that would be one thing but he tags himself and his wife in all of his “children’s” posts, so everyone on their friends lists would see them regardless. These kids are 2.5 and just newly born.

Anyway, I removed myself as a friend from the oldest child’s “account”, and declined the “request” from the newest child because his posts annoy the hell out of me and, since he tags himself and his wife, I see them multiple times anyway. Well, he noticed that I unfriended his oldest and haven’t accepted the request for the youngest and sent me a private message asking why. I proceeded to explain that I see the posts on his and his wife’s pages and don’t need to see the same post three and four times, planning to leave it at that. He responded how cruel I was to do that to a child.............

Being the reactive person that I am, I told him the reason that I don’t keep his toddler and infant as friends on Facebook is because the whole thing is very strange to me and that he should really spend his time being a father rather than impersonating his kids on social media.

My girlfriend “Jane” (22, F) and I have been dating for almost 6 months. Jane graduated college may 2019 and now is a swim teacher working 30 hours a week. Originally, she was attending community college to take classes for nursing, but she dropped them by October. Her reasoning was her chronic illness, called POTS. 

Jane’s main symptoms are intense pain in her body, shaking, problems with lightheadedness, etc. She usually has an episode about once a day, varying levels of pain and intensity. She’s been seeing doctors and takes medication. She quit nursing school to “focus more on herself” in September.

However, since then, Jane hasn’t really done a lot. She still works at the part time job and lives with her dad. When I try taking about her getting a job with reliable hours and benefits. She gets upset. 

 Early December, I tried helping her get a seasonal job to make some money in the meantime. She didn’t do it and cried when I tried to help her make some extra money with a dog walking app.
Before you all ask, yes, she is going to therapy. However, her therapist is on leave until March.

Am I the asshole because I push her and get mad when she doesn’t do anything? 

I want her to get a job with insurance and stop defining herself by her chronic illness. And I say this because I want the best for her as my partner and best friend. And yes, I believe Jane defines herself by her illness. I told her, and she agrees. Almost everything she does, she accompanies with how “useless” she is and “stupid” her body is because it doesn’t regulate right. She’s been working on her self-deprecating behavior, but this past weekend has been a tipping point. It’s out of control. All I want is the best for her. She’s my girlfriend and my best friend. I love spending time with her, and I care about her… but she just isn’t really trying.

Edit: I forgot to add I just want her to leave her current living situation because her dad is emotionally abusive.  This is why I want her to be independent.

I go to see this cosmetologist that specializes is coloring hair these very vibrant gradients. It’s really hard to get an appointment with them, but I wanted to make sure I got my hair done before I went on a trip with my friends.

For those of you who don’t know it’s important to not wash your hair for a few days before you get it bleached so you have a lot of natural oils to protect your scalp from the chemicals.

Anyway I was able to get a last minute appointment and it turned out to be the day after my cousins wedding. The wedding where my cousin wanted me and our two other cousins to be her bridesmaids. I didn’t really want to, but felt like I had to since this cousin doesn’t have many friends.

I didn’t think it would be a big deal though because I thought I could just put my greasy hair up into a bun like I always do before I get colored to be more presentable. I don’t like how my hair feels when it’s down and dirty anyway. Even with dry shampoo it makes me feel uncomfortable and cringe.

My cousin told all us in a group text a few days before her wedding that she was going to have a hair stylist do all our hair before the wedding so we would all have some nice matching beach wave look.

I messaged her back privately that I probably wouldn’t be able to do that because my hair is dirty and wouldn’t look good down because it’s so greasy. She said to just wash it. I told her why I couldn’t and she didn’t message me back.

When I got to the venue the next day my aunt told me I would be next to get my hair done. I told her I couldnt because my hair would be greasy and gross and I wouldn’t feel comfortable. 

My aunt tried to give me the keys to her room (wedding was in a hotel) to quickly go wash it. I told her why I couldn’t. She seemed to think that that was ridiculous. Luckily the stylist doing my cousins hair backed me up and explained how it would be painful to get my hair bleach if it was clean. 

While she helped me fix my hair to look a little nicer my aunt left grumbling how I should have rescheduled my hair coloring. My cousin also seemed annoyed with me for the rest of the night and when we were taking pictures.

Mainly because of the toxic relationship between my dad and I. I moved to my fiance's, who is going to be referred to F now, home and have been happy ever since. Able to sleep better, feel more comfortable rambling, etc.. Not long after moving, I was pretty much forced to get a new phone as my parents could track me down on my old one due to it being on their plan and whatnot, which led to a lot of problems. I paid for this new phone with my own money, and have been paying the bills for it as well.

A few weeks after the move, I made an agreement with my mother to make phone calls every Sunday to catch up. Well, I've only made these calls through F's phone as we both agree we can't trust my dad in having my new phone number. Long story short, I got sick and tired of this situation being a one way street of me making the phone calls. I haven't made the phone calls in order to see if they would eventually, but even that has ended up being a problem since my dad called my work a couple weeks back and asked my general manager when I worked next, which, luckily, was against the law and my GM was smarter than that. 

Now, F and I agreed to go to my grandparents' on my mom's side for a late Christmas celebration on Sunday. We were there for about 3 hours and the entire time was just painful to be at. Nobody really interacted with F except my siblings and grandparents. My grandparents even got him a gift of a bunch of Hershey kisses and a gift card. The only time my father interacted with me was when F wasn't around. Proof being that my dad approached me after F went to go get something from his car. Just as we were about to leave, Dad decided that he needed to talk to me. F was aware that I was uncomfortable and hence, why we needed to leave. This was the second and last time I had to interact with Dad before I went. 

Dad was going on about how he and my family missed me, about how I'm always welcome back, etc., but the part that angered me the most is F being called controlling because he won't let me call my mom on any other phone but his. May I remind you that I also thought that my dad shouldn't have my number. My dad also states that ""I know how he feels"" about F, which also pissed me off because I love F very much. I kept denying the phone I have, which was in F's car hidden away. 

After an uncomfortable conversation, I was finally able to get away and after saying goodbye, F and I left. I told F about the conversation and he was furious about being called controlling since my dad was rather controlling as well when I was around.

So I adopted (edit for clarity: legal guardianship but with no chance of her returning to her birth mother, although she still has contact which has to be supervised) my niece as she was taken away from her mother (my sister) due to unexplained injuries at 18 months old. She spent the best part of a year in foster care and I knew that I didn’t want to lose her so put myself forward to take her on as her legal guardian.

She still has contact with her mother but only a few times a year. I work full time so my niece attends day care quite a bit. Within the first month of her placement she started calling me ‘mummy (my name)’, I asked my case worker what I should do and they suggested I allow her to call me this as she may feel rejected otherwise. 

I’ve always said she can refer to me however she wishes and that when she’s older she can make up her own mind.

I have always had a tense relationship with my sisters (I have a few) so knew going into this that it would be a tough ride. My sister posted something on Facebook about how her child is growing and my other sister commented saying that she should be proud and it’s down to her hard work. I have very supportive and protective friends so after seeing this a couple decided to post their own comments to me personally about how I am doing a good job as a mother.

Before I even see these comments I have received a direct message saying that these comments are disgusting and I should be ashamed, I apologised and removed the messages, but then another friend comments something similar and my sister told me that it I am evil for raising my niece to believe I am her mother. Just to clarify - I have never told her what to call me and always talk to her about her mummy.

I know my sister is hurting, when I told her I don’t think I can have my own children (after a visit to the Doctors) she said I shouldn’t fill that hole with my niece, I’m worried that I may be doing that.

No  charges were pressed, but she wasn't allowed back onto the premises. I  ended up taking care of him and my mother by myself for the two weeks he was there. She knew I was not happy with what she had done, and I didn't really talk to her except as necessary until Thanksgiving 2010.

Thanksgiving 2010 is when it all went down. Dinner was at my mother's place, my sister still lived with her at the time, and it was going to be me, my boyfriend, and most of my mother's family. My sister started talking shit about me to the rest of the  family saying how I never help her, that I won't lift a finger to help mom (not true and mom backed me on that), and the outed me as gay as we sat down to eat dinner to the rest of the family who didn't know. She even tried to drag my boyfriend into it which he wasn't happy about. She continued on, even though everyone was trying to get her to calm down. I got pissed, and that's when it came to a head. I let the family know what she did at the hospice, and how she was banned from there as our father passed away.

My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years, are in our mid 30s and have been talking about getting engaged. 

I like to think I am pretty open minded about porn of different forms, and enjoy it myself from time to time. “Traditional” methods of porn don’t bother me. Ie: porn sites. 

I do have an issue with craigslist, Facebook profiles, and escort websites as a form of fap-material. Pretty much anything where the person being fapped to could be easily contacted. 

It may add context that my boyfriend has been with sex workers and hooked up using Craigslist in the past (before we were together). His history doesn’t bother me. I trust him that he has not “crossed the line” and met up with anyone in person since we have been together. 

He feels as though because he doesn’t ever message anyone or fap to Facebook profiles he actually knows in person (just friends of friends or people in the comment sections) that it isn’t an issue, and I am being controlling. 

He says I would have an issue if he told me I couldn’t watch certain genres of porn - which I agree with, but don’t think this is the same thing. He feels like this is essentially the same.

I was VERY naive and somehow thought she liked me, so I hinted it to her. Very obviously. I wrote her an anonymous love letter (mainly as a joke, and my best friend even told her it was a joke), I was always staring at her every chance I got and I continuously told my friends to go and tell her that I liked her, which she didn’t believe and mainly just ignored.
A few years later after I stopped liking her, in the middle of class, she asked my best friend if I liked her. Since I hadn’t told my best friend that I stopped liking her and I was also confused about it myself, my best friend, not wanting to lie but also not wanting to tell her directly, didn’t say anything, which my crush took as a sign that I liked her. She started avoiding me. Since I didn’t like her anymore at this point, I was no longer telling my friends to go confess for me or writing her love letters or anything like that. Anyway, one time I was sitting next to her in a liturgy and she got up and moved as far away from me as possible, and I almost started crying. One time we had to be partners in class, and she rushed all of her work in like 0.00002 seconds and then went to the bathroom for the remainder of the partner work.
One day, my best (and at that time only) friend ditched me to hang out with my crush. She started hanging out with them every day. Edit, 2 things: 1 - my crush was one of the popular girls and I was the weird shy girl, so this didn’t help, and 2 - either my crush or my best friend or one of the other popular girls started a rumour that I didn’t find out about until after school had ended that my best friend ditched me because I “wasn’t cool enough” for her. Anyway, back to the story - I had no friends. There was at least one time where I hid in a bathroom stall by myself crying for the entire lunch. Eventually I got new friends and even made amends with my old best friend.
On one of the last days of primary school, my best friend came up to me and told me that when she was just in the bathroom, my crush came up to her and told her to tell me that I’m a bitch and I should fuck off.

However, his best friend has done some pretty horrible things and I want to know if I am the asshole if I ask him to stop seeing him.

For the record, I am not one of those crazy people who forbid their significant other from having friends. I just don't think that I can be with Chris when he tolerates someone who is such a horrible person.

His best friend, Patrick and I have seen each other 3 times so far. Each time he has harassed women said lude things to me and made everyone else uncomfortable. He has repeatedly commented on my breasts and how sexy I am, while in front of Chris. He has also done this to other women, despite being repeatedly asked to stop.

On New Year's my boyfriend had a small get together. Patrick was invited and made many girl's so uncomfortable they left early. When I addressed it with Chris he said ""that's just the way Patrick is. He's not really capable of changing"".

Patrick also came to the party very sick and was kissing people without their permission. I just had surgery last week and I am was warned to be careful because my immune system was compromised.  I strictly told him I don't want him to kiss me or touch me. He ignored this and kissed me at least 3 different times. I now have a cold and although it's hard to prove where it came from, I am sure it is him. Each time he went to kiss me I told him to stop and pushed him away.

Patrick got so drunk on New Year's he walked into Chris's roommate's room naked. He scared everyone and was belligerently drunk. He also said inappropriate things to every woman at the party.

The other times I met him he did basically the same stuff.

Patrick has straight-up groped women (me included) and won't accept responsibility for it. And honestly, I won't tolerate it anymore.

I have talked to Chris about this all. He said he tried to talk to Patrick, but obviously it didn't work. Am I the asshole if I tell Chris he can either see me or continue his friendship with Patrick?

I have mice. I've had mice since I was in fifth grade (I'm in 9th now). However, as I've gotten older, I've gotten interest in other animals. Currently, for a pet I want snails. Strange, I know, but they're absolute cuties. 

There are two mice that I have that I got at the same time to keep company to a mouse that sadly passed away recently. Unfortunately, getting two at once was a horrible idea and one of the two actually attacked my solo mouse. 

This made my heart and bond with them break. The one mouse is the one that hurt the solo mouse, and the other never comes out because she's scared of everything. 

Now I want to get rid of these two mice and be done with them for now once the baby I have passed away in a few years.

I don't know if I'm in the wrong for this, but I feel like I am. I'd be selling them at $10 including the cage and items they already have, the new owner would just need to buy food.

So AITA for not caring for these mice until they're passed away as well or not, friends of Reddit? (Constructive criticism is appreciated if you have any :))

"ej7rs4","1578014217","AITA for not visiting my wife's mother while I was in town?","A little background:

My (now) wife and I moved 1500 miles from our hometown nearly a decade ago. We are now married with a toddler. We go home to visit for Christmas every two years, this year was the off year we were not set to go home for the holiday. As we had no plans to go visit over Christmas, my wife's mother and boyfriend came down to visit us for three days a few weeks before Christmas. Their visit was a disaster.   


They rented a place an hour and thirty minutes from our house and did not rent a car. They wanted to ""be in the big city"". We have four dogs and no one to dog sit so I had no choice but to drive back and forth all weekend to care for the dogs. We drove down each day and hung out then I would drive back mid day to let the dogs out, then drive back down to pick up the wife and kid to drive back home for the night (our son recently started having issues sleeping well in new places, and the dogs have to go out in the morning and at night). Overall we spent far more time commuting back and forth than spending time with her family. It was unfortunate as her Grandmother and Aunt ended up joining them last minute and they were unaware the place my wifes mother rented for them (separate AirBnb as Grandma won't sleep under the roof of a couple who is not married) was an hour and a half from our house. Her Grandma and Aunt apologized profusely, stating how insane this whole situation was.  


Now, to the part where you decide AITA.  


I have three siblings, two of which have kids. I get to see them and their kids *maybe once a year* if I am lucky. Sometimes 18 months go by between visits. On December 21st I was speaking with my wife and decided it might be nice to use some of my Southwest points for my son and I to fly north to see my family just after Christmas while everyone was around. It would work out great, my son and I would fly north for 4 days and my wife would have a great 4 days of rest and relaxation (she is a stay at home Mom, and I try to give her extended breaks whenever I have the time off of work to do so). We booked the ticket, and my son and I headed out on the 27th. We spent the time with my son hanging out with my family and never left my parents house.  


As my son and I were on our flight back my wife got a text from her mom. She wanted to know if our family was visiting the state without saying anything. It turns out that my sister added photos of my son to a Google Photos folder we keep for him, and her Mom saw the photos and was not pleased about it.

"ej7sob","1578014329","AITA for trying to go to my Step Nephew’s hearing to support him?","My sister has been with someone for a few years and that person has a son. They were married last hear so now he is my step nephew. Let’s call him Fred, he is in his early 20’s and suffers from severe mental illness. We’ve bonded a bit over mental illness as I have been hospitalized a couple of times before and he has spent most of the last year in the hospital. 

His parents are have been across the country visiting sick relatives for the last week or so. This is at a time when he had a hearing scheduled that determines his fate for the next 3 years. He doesn’t know anyone in this area, literally only his parents, me, and his medical team. 

I feel like it’s important to have someone at all of his hearings that’s familiar to him that he can feel like is rooting for him. If he wants that. Since they are out of town I offered to be at the hearing and asked that they let me know when it was scheduled so I could contact him and ask if he wanted me there.  They tried to persuade me that he doesn’t need anyone other than his social worker (supposedly most families never visit, let alone attend hearings) but I insisted that I give him the option. 

Today my sister made a cutesy post about how the hearing is about to happen and a lawyer mistook her for his mother in law over the phone. I messaged her asking why she hadn’t told me the hearing was today like she said she would.  She moved the conversation to one with our other sister and said she hadn’t said she would do that. A few minutes later she said even if she did she didn’t mean it. My other sister jumped in and asked why would I expect to be invited to something like that. I explained it was up to Fred and I wanted him to have the option of a friendly face.  The other sister started mocking me because she “wouldn’t let you near any hearings for my kids.” The first sister poked at me too saying she didn’t have to tell me anything regardless of wether she had already agreed to.

I got irritated and, this may make me TA, said it was shitty for them to abandon Fred at such an important time and to keep away people who could potentially make things easier on him. It’s not ok to “handle” mentally ill people by flat out lying to them so that they don’t inconvenience her. I’ve seen her do it to him a dozen times and now she’s doing it to me. They want me to play Aunt on his bday and at Christmas but not when it doesn’t suit them. In the future I plan to contact him directly and ask him what he wants instead of using them as an intermediary. They don’t understand the toll it takes to be locked away and not have anyone care enough to visit you. Before I saw him at Christmas, his parents hadn’t seen him in over a month.

"ej7x71","1578014901","AITA for not convincing my friend not to go out with one of my former classmates?","Using one of my throwaways for this question. So the background is that I completed a competitive Masters program a few years ago. My friend, who I went to undergrad with in the Midwest, moved from the Midwest down to the major city where I live. 

Once she moved here, she joined our local alumni chapter, and started going to their football watching parties. At one of these parties, she met ""Brian"" who happened to also go to our undergraduate school for his first masters, and he went to grad school with me for his second masters. They got to talking, and she learned all about how much money he makes, the investment properties that he owns, and his home in the expensive part of the city we live in. She said that they talked for the entire game and she met many of his friends too. 

So, some background on Brian. He had tried to talk to me me several times during our Masters program, but he is arrogant AF. He will talk over you, he only cares about himself, and is just in general thinks he is the most amazing person to grace your presence. I never entertained his advances because of all of this. I kept things strictly platonic. 

We went out for brunch, and she was telling me that she met Brian and was excited because they were scheduled to go on a date.  I was asking her, are you sure about that? He is kind of... eccentric. She got defensive and was like, ""well he has a great stable job, he invests his money well, and he has a great apartment, of course I am going to go out with him. He said that he knows you from school and that he thought I was pretty.""  And I asked her if she had talked to him for a long period of time and if she enjoyed the conversation. And she said ""of course, why else would I go out with him?""  She got defensive about it so I dropped it. If she had talked to to him and she didn't find his personality abrasive, I didn't want to seem like I was being jealous or a cockblock. I figured that maybe he just didn't jive with my personality and she and him might work out.  

So fast forward a week. We are meeting up for brunch again and she is agitated the whole time. I ask her what is up, and she kind of explodes on me like ""Why didn't I tell her that he is so arrogant."" She said they went on a date and the whole time he just talked about himself and talked over her (shocker). I told her that I did try to tell her but she said that she enjoyed his company and got defensive about it so I dropped it. She said that it didn't matter and should have still told her that he was so arrogant.  I again repeated that she said that she enjoyed his company so I didn't press the issue with her any further. 

Things haven't really been the same since that incident. She keeps bringing it up like if we are going to go somewhere she will say ""Well I guess we can go, but hopefully you are being truthful about how good it is.""

My fiancée loves my sister too but she is adamant that my sister does NOT attend our wedding.

He also offered to pay for cosmetic surgery more than once (nose job and fillers), which, as a teenager who was already struggling with self esteem, didn't exactly make me feel better. There was other stuff, too, but that was the most common issue he had with me.

There's more, but the quick backstory is that mom pressured me into moving to my dad's house (divorced) when I was 13, but promised me it was on a ""trial"" basis & I could move back whenever I wanted. I begged her to move back after every semester for years, & she always said no. I even got her promise in writing, still no.

Even before that, she always gave preferential treatment to my sisters & stepdad's feelings/needs over mine. When he told me right in front of her that ""95% of this family's problems are your fault"" she said nothing to defend me. That was the last straw that convinced me to move out. For the record, I'm sure I was a hormonal little shit, but I was a nerd & a  straight A student and never got into any kind of real trouble. My stepdad was arrested less than a year later for exposing himself in public. She forgave him immediately & we have basically been awkwardly pressured into never discussing it ever since. I'm now a mom and can't fathom her thinking on any of this.

There are many smaller examples, but more recently...

When I had a miscarriage, she told me she was glad my dad and MIL could come help me because she was ""saving all [her] vacation time for when [sister]'s baby is born."" (For the record sister's baby was due exactly ONE DAY after the baby I lost). She eventually apologized, but I don't think she really understood why I was upset because she said, ""I'm sorry I don't know the correct thing to say because I've never had a miscarriage.""

Everyone describes her as ""a saint"" & wonderful mother (even my dad, stepmom & sisters), & that she's a ""great listener."" Yes, she is generally nice and doesn't yell, hit or verbally abuse me, but everything goes in one ear and out the other, & she forgets literally everything remotely bad that has ever happened.

Ex.: Her mom died when she was 21, & she has almost no memories of her mom and doesn't even know what she died of. According to her, I chose to move to my dad's because I ""didn't have a lot of friends at school"" (true, but I loved them & missed them), I could go on...  TBH, I haven't tried to talk to her about anything of substance in about 10 years (I'm in my early 30s) but that's  because every time I'd bring up anything where I felt she was in the wrong, she'd start crying & saying what a horrible mother she is, & I end up trying to make her feel better. 

So, AITA for keeping her at a distance & not trying to talk to her about this stuff? I just don't honestly see myself getting anything out of it but more frustration/pain.

Cooper, the golden, was a gift to

1. I have already seen it 
2. I dont actually have a lot of money atm 
3. I dont actually like going out with my sisters just because kids annoy me in public places.

She has tons of other sponsors but I put in a sizable amount of money towards the camp and I let them borrow my shuttle van (GMC 15 passenger van). We recently broke up and it was mutual. 


Still since I’m no longer dating her I don’t have a reason to let them use my van or give them funding. The summer camp starts in May so they have plenty of time to make up the additional money and rent a van. To me it’s no big deal. She was telling me some of my money went to scholarships for the kids that can’t afford the camp and without it they won’t be able to go. That’s nothing but a guilt trip.

I posted a pic of me in the hospital bed with my leg in a cast on instagram. A lot of people from school started commenting on it just giving me a few words of support. 

One of the people who commented was a girl called Rachel. She's the school's head girl, and for the past few years has terrorised Becky every single day with her friends. She's a truly nasty piece of work who would have been kicked out of school if she was anyone else (she does a lot of drugs and has poor attendance). Unfortunately she's super smart and gets high grades so they ignore all that and gave her the head girl job. 

Rachel commented on my picture saying ''Thinking of you, hope you feel better soon xxxx''. Bear in mind the only time I speak to her is defending Becky from her. That in mind I responded to her comment ''Don't want your support. Fuck off.'' 

Normally everyone sides with Rachel and her friends over me and Becky, but this time everyone found me shutting her down hilarious. People were screenshotting it and putting it on their stories. 

Rachel then made a long instagram video sobbing, saying she was being bullied online by everyone sharing that screenshot, and calling me and Becky bullies for saying it. She tried to say Becky made me say that because she was jealous of Rachel's appearance or something like that, even though Becky didn't even know I'd written that. 

Naturally everyone sided with her again, and everyone was saying how horrible I am for humiliating a girl like that, as though it wasn't them sharing the picture around. I don't think I did anything wrong. She terrorises my girlfriend on a daily basis, and had the cheek to try and send me good thoughts.

"ej8kn3","1578017926","WIBTA for Reporting my Neighbor's Dog (Barks At All Hours, All Day Every Day)","Hello Reddit - long time lurker, first-time poster.

Title pretty much says it all. I live in a first-ring suburb in a fairly major city in the Midwest, with my backyard being somewhat small, yet fenced in. My backyard fence butts up against the neighbors' backyard space, so while there is some privacy, noise carries easily.

About 3 months ago, our neighbors must have gotten a dog because I've never heard a dog bark in the yard behind mine. I have a 1.5 story house, so from my upstairs, I've been able to look down into the neighbor's backyard to see a German Shepherd looking dog standing outside the sliding glass door of their 4-season porch on their rambler home.

I'm not sure if these people are just letting their dog out and forgetting about it, but it will sit at the door and bark/howl for at least 30+ minutes every time. This occurs several times per day, from as early as 5 am some mornings to as late as midnight some nights. This is extremely annoying because I don't have to wake up until 7:30 am most mornings, while my girlfriend cannot fall back asleep once woken up by the dog because she gets up around 6:30 am. Even with a fan running for white noise, we can still hear this dog at night when we are in bed trying to sleep.

I worked from home today and have heard this exact situation unfold 5-6 times, and it is happening right now as I write this. I believe these owners to be incompetent in owning a dog since it is winter here nearly 6 months out of the year and can get below 20 degrees Fahrenheit quite often. While the dog may have thick fur, I believe you should not leave your dog outside for long, extended periods of time while it is clearly barking to be let in. I do feel bad for the dog because I think the owners are the assholes here.

The question is, WIBTA for reporting the owners and their dog to the police for being a public nuisance due to his incessant barking/howling (and/or animal services for being neglected for being left outside for long periods of time)? He was outside barking/howling for an hour straight at one point this afternoon alone, not sure if anyone was home.

I'm contemplating leaving a typed out note in their mailbox in the coming week, simply addressed as coming from ""Your Neighbors"" implying that there is many of us who this is bothering and that they aren't treating their dog fairly or being respectful of the entire neighborhood area by leaving him outside for extended periods of time, causing him to bark/howl quite loudly. It should be noted that you can hear his barking/howling from inside all of the rooms of my house except the basement.

FWIW, I am a dog person and I love dogs. The difference is that I would let my dog inside after he's been barking/howling for 5+ minutes after letting him out to go to the bathroom or run around for a bit.","False","Not the A-hole","3","16"
"ej8kx0","1578017964","AITA for calling my boyfriend out for borrowing money without asking?","My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 months and I’m over at his place at least 5 days out of the week. We have a healthy relationship and agree on most big things, but recently something happened that made me question his judgement. 

I got a money transfer from my father for Christmas, $800 in cash. Until I go back to my house, there are no nearby ATMs and I have been keeping it in his locked watch case (only for about 3-4 days). He knows I have it and knows exactly where it’s from. On NYE I wasn’t at his place yet and wouldn’t be for a few hours, so he agreed to pick up the alcohol for celebrations. I told him he could take a $20 from my cash to put towards the alcohol. I specifically said only $20 and what it was for.

He picked up liquor then went to get a haircut, I arrived at his house a bit before him. Once he got home, we were hanging out just watching TV for over an hour before he turned to me and told me he took another $20 from the cash to pay for his haircut. For reference, his barber accepts debit/credit cards; my boyfriend chooses to pay cash because he think the card runner they have is sketchy (or that’s what he told me at least.) 

I got upset and told him I was uncomfortable with the fact that he took the money without asking, and waited that long to tell me. I told him I wouldn’t care if he had just asked beforehand, or even just sent me a text as he left the house along the lines of “hey I’m sorry but I borrowed an extra $20 for my haircut, I hope that’s ok. I’ll pay you back.” 
When he told me, he didn’t even say at first that he would pay me back. He just told me flat out “I took an extra $20 to pay for my haircut.” 

When I spoke out about it he got angry and acted like I was being unreasonable. He got mad at me for “starting an argument over nothing.” 

To be clear, I didn’t yell at him or anything. I was just obviously upset and called him out for it. I have absolutely no problems sharing money; I’ve loaned him money before, and we’re always splitting the cost for going out, groceries, household supplies, etc. It’s only $20, I just don’t want to set any standard that it’s okay to take something like cash from each other without at least asking. 

AITA?

EDIT: thank you for all your responses this quickly! I would like to ask that no one bash my boyfriend or prejudge his entire personality over this one incident. If he did this constantly we would not be together; I’m asking because his actions surprised me and I was questioning my reaction.

"ej8pqz","1578018594","AITA for treating my uncle badly?","I live with my grandparents and have all my life, they're basically my parents. From no age I have always hated my uncle he was mean to me, mentally abused me and his now ex was his teammate in making my life a misery. He stole and sold family members stuff to pay for his drug problem, he put drugs before his own kids.

Since then my uncle took a breakdown and is now a diagnosed schizophrenic, lost his family and is now in a hospice but has been staying on and off in my house since May 2019 after my grandad took a heart attack, I knew my uncle would use it as a way to sneak his way in whenever my grandmother is at her most vulnerable because when my gran was in hospital he knew my grandfather would not fall for his tricks so he couldn't slither his way in.

Since May I have made it known to him I don't want him here but what took the cake was when he started to disobey rules in the house such as no smoking in the house only for him on a day where my grandparents went out for the day for him to smoke in the bathroom and for me to confront him for him to call me a nutcase etc and how he took the help that was offered to him and how I should do the same. I blew up and for the first time ever I cursed at him and before he could shout at me I reminded him of my age being 21 at the time now 22, he realised if he tried to pull the 'she cursed at me' card to my grandparents that I was the one with the control and not him unlike when I was younger. I have taken great pleasure in causing him as much pain, anger, the isolation that he brought on to me as a young child over jealously off me getting things he didn't as a child when there was 5 of my grandparent's child including my mum and when I was born their youngest was 12 and my uncle was 14, I was the new baby of the family.

My grandparents are too old to deal with stuff that they had to with my uncle such as people coming to their door asking for his drug money, police at the door, getting his younger brother to fight his fights for him and many of the injuries from glass bottles I have witnessed, stealing from our family and breaking into family members house to get drug money, stealing my birthday and Christmas presents to fund his habits, Punching my underage brother in the face for telling my uncle to clean up his own mess.

I think he deserves the life he has now of feeling unwanted, he is a lowlife scum who was selfish and it's too late to say sorry.

Edit: He has been having munchies when taking drugs and has eaten food that I have given money towards the house for, he is like a vulture waiting to watch the tv, he leaves messes behind him, takes food that doesn't belong to him, he pays no money towards the house, He tries to take over my brothers room when he stays over, he is causing fights between my grandparents because he is my grandmothers blue eye because he almost died as a baby and my mum was schizophrenic so my grandmother doesn't want events that happened with my mum to happen with my uncle and my uncle is taken advantage of that.

Edit: Things I have done is rat out his behaviour, delete shows he has recorded, hide the remote control, put herbs on the countertop to look like a weed to get him kicked out for a week (he takes weed so I am just exposing his habit that is fully known but will get him kicked out if he takes it in the house). My grandfather thinks he is worming his way in to move in if anything happens to my grandparents which if it does the door is being locked and he isn't getting in.","1578019532.0","Not the A-hole","7","7"

This is the first party I've had since moving in two years ago, and I'm generally pretty quiet, live alone, like to read and game, etc. Folks started showing up at 6 pm, and we hung around in the living room eating, drinking, and listening to (mellow) music for a few hours.

Around 10:30 several of my guests headed out ahead of us to walk downtown, and as they were leaving they stood at the bottom of my stairs for \~5 minutes shooting the shit and talking. They were pretty drunk so probably being loud and obnoxious, but nobody was fighting or screaming or anything. My downstairs neighbor and her boyfriend came out and asked them to be quiet because they had to wake up at 5 am the next morning (New Year's Day) for work. I heard them come out and quickly went downstairs to see what was up - I was also pretty drunk at this point but I told her I was really sorry they woke her up, told the guys to get a move on and get away from her window (which they did), and drunkenly asked her and her boyfriend if they wanted some wine. The boyfriend angrily said ""no"" and went back inside and slammed the door. I apologized again to my downstairs neighbor, told her the party would be heading out at 11, ended the convo there and went back inside.

I will be calling biological mom (mom) and my husband (dad) to preserve privacy. 

To add before we all get started, we are on great terms. I'm a step mom of three kiddos, I live with dad, and mom lives with her girlfriend. We are all planning on moving into a big house together to help co parenting, bonding with the kids and what not becuase we have had full custody. They didnt have it taken, they told us until they could move out of their mice infected home, the kids didnt deserve to be around that. They are super clean people, just in a trailer that needs renovating bad. We are good friends. 

I've been a stay at home mom for these kids this whole time, working a month or two here and there when dad was out of work or was let go. 

Yesterday, I got wind of a job opening at dad's work, a wonderful workplace, and I wouldn't be in the same department, so separate but close work lives. I was thrilled and went to mom to ask if her schedule after we moved in together after tax season could be changed from her 2 to 3 days a week at the mall to her dream just the weekend shift. She said hell yeah, just give her time to talk to her boss as soon as we know. 

Today, i got the call from dad saying the job was expiring today, so I needed to apply NOW as they have alot of applicants. I did, still under the impression it was a month or two out. Well, turns out they want 5 positions filled by the end of January. Way ahead of schedule. 

In response to this, we called around and found a way to make this work without involving mom at all till the move as planned. This was all great! Except mom does not like who we asked, becuase they are all we had. Dads mom (grandma). Mom and grandma are not on good terms because of alot of things, and mom hates the kids seeing her at all, but we cant afford to pay a regular person to start. Mom does not like strangers, daycare, or his mom. But on the other hand, cant watch them herself to start with becuase they have 1 car and the kids need picked up at the same time her gf gets off work. 

Mom does not drive, and we do not have a car, so this is a huge problem. We have to catch the bus at 7:30, and that is when the only car between us is available is after 7:30. 

So. We planned grandma to come, take care of all of it just for now till the move, and mom is not having any of it. Saying we blindsided her, this is not fair, we should know she hates her, and this is rushed without taking her personal feelings into account. 

I stayed firm saying this opportunity, if chosen, would not be for a few weeks, and would end the daycare as soon as we move in together. She didnt like that either. I stayed firm that I want this job, and doubling our income to over 3k a month could afford us a car, a nicer house and the ability to pick farther away homes, but she didnt seem to care.

“Both of the kids have tournaments the weekend of your weeding. I just want to verify you would be ok of they weren't able to come?”

I feel like going off because there is no verifying that I’d be ok with them not coming. I’m not ok with that. I love them and want them there.

Me: mom im 20 yrs old and i dont get to even have personal time until ALL my chores are done. And these aren't my chores. So no.. I wont do them. 

From there i called younger sibling and had her come all the way back home to do them, and as it was now 9PM it was too late to go back out. She says im the A-hole and my mom said it was petty. So I just wanna know.. AITA? 

Just wanted to address a few things instead of answering to every comment (which i appreciated no matter how rude) 

1. Yes there was a handful of better ways I could have handled this situation, and I now realize that. Tomorrow morning I will be apologizing and discussing some house rules to help at least maintain things while my sister and I are working. I admit i shouldn't have let work place frustrations harm my relationships at home. 

2. A lot of people are kinda blaming my older sister for ""dumping the kids"" on my mother. We've had countless discussions and even going behind my mothers back to get the children a babysitter (which we found quite a few well qualified ones) but mom heavily protests against it. Not sure why, but i am the child she is the parent and I nor my older sister can change the things she wants unfortunately.  

3. Having the dishes as a chore one day out of the week shouldn't be a problem for a 15 year old. At that age for both my sister and i we had an entire week of chores that included dishes, laundry, and yard work. And we HATED IT. so to give her a sense of responsibility, she has ONE day out of the week. That way she has time to leave the house and get her own personal time (she's a teen. She DEFIANTLY needs it.)  
 

I will be updating the outcome of our conversations tomorrow, and thank you once again for all of you guys insight on the situation. It means a lot to me. 

Update! I'm on my hour lunch at work so im gonna try and make this quick. We had a nice long discussion this morning. The discussions consisted of how everyone was feeling and what we can switch around to make a healthy change for everyone. I proceeded with giving out an apology to both my little sister and mother, as there was a better way to handle things and i shouldn't have gotten so frustrated. I vented on how I feel mom can be a bit more stern, which was agreed upon and we know have house rules updated. 
1. Before you leave finish chores and homework
2. Leave all outside stress, OUTSIDE. 
3. There will be a close friend whom we are paying to come over and assist with the house. 
They may not be baby sitting but they'll lend a hand in cleaning and any additional baby sitting things that she needs assistance in. 
As an apology to my younger sibling I offered to take her out to an arcade Saturday and she said yes! So I'm excited that she forgives me. I don't believe that I was the a-hole, but i believe calling her all the way back was a petty move. And I feel like without this situation happening we wouldn't have progressed. So I guess in a weird way im thankful? Idk. Please comment anything you'd like to ask and I'll try my best to answer as im In work. Thank you all!","1578073227.0","Everyone Sucks","22","58"
"ej91td","1578020165","AITA for being a close friend with my friend’s “ex”?","I go to college and my group of friends is consisted of 3 girls and 3 guys. Earlier this year, my closest female friend apparently had liked one of my male friends in the group and they started dating. After they started dating my female friend hasn’t changed the way she treats me in general, but naturally she became much closer to my friend obviously because they’re dating and she’d tell him all her issues and close stuff and spend the most of the time talking to him. Everything was totally fine for like 6 months until recently, apparently she has lost feelings for him because he started showing his insecurities in the relationship which made her feel uncomfortable and lose interest etc.. so they both agreed to get back to being close friends. They both told me what happened and they both told me they wanted to remain friends and I felt like they two were okay with that. Until this part of the story I really have nothing to do with what happened, but after their relationship ended my friendship with the female friend became much stronger (mainly due to her making efforts again) and she’d vent to me and ask to spend some time together. Apparently after this started happening my guy friend accused me of “trying to steal her” and he said I really shouldn’t be close with her and I should respect his feelings.

She found the post, sent me a screenshot and said that I should have offered to give it back. 

I don't care about the money but this sister-in-law left the family 10+ years ago so we aren't close and I do like the shelf and preferred it go to someone who would like it instead of in the trash. The other sister who got a shelf sold her house and left it there but that wasn't a problem.

She was in my home this summer (first time in 12 years) and didn't notice it wasn't hanging, I'm convinced that she only remembered the shelf when she saw it posted for sale.  She can have it if she asks but instead she sent a nasty text and called me rude, making it sound like I'm a terrible person and she's a real victim whose 18 yo gift is not being appreciated.

"ej9cg2","1578021532","AITA for not stepping up one way or another when my FIL played with my dog?","So just to provide a little context, my brother is a very passive and loving person and my husband and his family are more straightforward and obnoxious. There is quite a bit of tension in the house because of politics, but that’s a whole other story. 

So I have a single dog that is large, like 50-60 lbs. She has always roughhoused with the biggest of the big dogs, especially pits and bullies. Whenever we had a bunch of dogs, one of the funnest ways to encourage their zoomies is to pat them loudly on the butt a few times, the goal being to make a loud noise and certainly not to harm them. In my experience, this sends our pups into excitement frenzy and they launch off, butt down, into spin moves or even faster zoomies or whatever. This has been the way we have played for years, and my FIL is a huge dog person, always bringing homemade dog treats that he has specially made for the dogs, training them, petting them, and building individual relationships with each one. 

Christmas Day, Maddie, my dog, instigated play with my FIL by talking to him (she has a yodel/talking sound she makes when she wants to get someone’s attention and start playing) and they start playing with toys and my dog goes off in a zoomies tizzy, with FIL scratching her back, playing tug of war, and patting her butt as per usual. Maddie suddenly thinks food was dropped/put into her bowl, and my FIL gives her one last, loud pat on the butt, and my brother goes off with a “You don’t have to hit her like that”. 

So now I’m concerned, was I the AH not defending my FIL? Was I the AH for playing with my dog like this for all these years? She seems to love it, and I’m the first advocate for ensuring my dog is comfortable in her own home.","False","No A-holes here","4","8"

I hosted the company party at my house for about 20-30 people. My colleague helped set up but had to leave early because she was sick with a stomach virus. The party was pot-luck style, so she brought a cake a friend had made. She seemed excited about it, I asked her if she wanted to take a piece for later, but she said she felt too sick and we should try to save some.

The party ends and I have a bunch of food including this half of a cake leftover. It was on a nice plate, so I texted her to see if she was feeling any better for me to drop the stuff off. She was still sick and ended up in the hospital for a day or two. At this point, the cake is at least a week old, I ask my chef friend who agrees I should throw it out.

Today, I brought the plate to the office and she asked me where the cake was. I thought she was kidding, but she was genuinely mad that I tossed it. Apparently the cake wasn't cheap and she was upset she didn't get to try it. (I had no idea she paid for it.) She said I should have called her before throwing it away. I thought the last thing anyone would want in the hospital with the stomach virus was to be bothered with an old cake. I offered to give her money for it, but she was still pissed.

Gf invited me out, told me meet at her mom’s at 5pm. We’re there for a few hours having predrinks and a couple tokes before catching an Uber to the bar she wanted to go to. 
I had woken up late (noon) and hadn’t eaten at all during the day. I expected, since she asked me over for 5pm that we would be eating at some point after going out. Turns out the bar she wanted to go to doesn’t serve food. Great. 
So we have a few beers, her friend comes by for a pint during which time I may as well have not been there. Sure, she let me know that said friend would be joining us, but I mean I literally said no more than 10 sentences during the hour or so her friend was with us. 

The three of us got into a discussion about umami and what that actually meant. My gf said she thought it was a specific taste and flavor, to which I disagreed with saying that it was more of a  combination of taste, texture, and other things that make up personal preference. 

When she insisted that it was a specific flavor I said that what she was saying was didn’t coincide with what I had learned working under real chefs and called the whole industry, as well as her opinion, pretentious.

In doing so, I hurt her feelings and left her feeling very offended because she interpreted that to mean I was calling her pretentious.  

We talked back and forth for a bit while I acted quite unapologetic for calling her opinion pretentious. As a result, I got ditched at the bar that doesn’t serve food and now I have to find my own way back while simultaneously think of a proper apology to make it up to her.

Me and my girlfriend like to joke around and tease eachother. So when my sister texted my girlfriend, my girlfriend joked saying that “He yells at me a lot”, and that “I’m so mean to her”. The thing is, my girlfriend is talking about play fighting, and even though my sister knows this, she told my mom. My mom does not know how to read playfulness or anything like that so she thought my girlfriend was being serious. I got mad at my girlfriend telling her not to tell my sister our business because my sister can’t take a joke. Also because my sister tells my mom everything

To clarify with my girlfriend, I asked if I actually was mean to her, and she said “no, I was just joking, I didn’t expect your mom to get mad at you”. I didn’t get too mad at her but now my mom is disappointed in me.

"ej9hrm","1578022250","AITA For Calling My Sister-In-Law A Snob In A Joking Way?","This year my husband and I hosted Christmas for the first time. Normally we go back to his hometown where his mom hosts everyone. This year everyone came to us because I only had Christmas and Boxing Day off and it didn't make sense for us to travel so far for just 2 days.

I was a bit nervous because my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law are both amazing at cooking and baking and I know I am not as good as them. I know a lot of it has to do with the fact that they both have way more time than I do (neither of them work) so I asked in the group chat if they could contribute. They both agreed and they did follow through with bringing a lot of delicious things. This isn't the issue at all (obviously), but I just wanted to show why I was feeling on edge about hosting.

Anyway, things were going well while everyone was there. While I was at work on Christmas Eve my sister-in-law and the kids (her daughters plus my husband's younger brother's son) were making cupcakes for my husband's birthday celebration that night. Apparently I didn't have the ""right kind"" of vanilla or white chocolate or milk (???) so my sister-in-law took the older kids to the store. 

I had only a half-day of work on Christmas Eve so when I came home I saw only my husband and his mom in the yard playing with his youngest niece. When they told me where everyone else was I said (in a joking way) to my husband's niece, ""your mom is such a snob"". My husband and his mom looked at me like I had grown 2 heads! His niece is too young to even know what that means and the only other people at the house were my husband's brothers and they were inside watching a movie.

Anyway, apparently someone told my sister-in-law what I said. She never said anything about it to me the whole time they were here. She didn't indicate that she had a problem with me so obviously I didn't think there was a problem. That's not what my husband thinks though. He said I need to apologize to my sister-in-law AND his mom. Apparently his mom thinks I was ""catty"" and my sister-in-law thinks I don't like her (apparently his brother told him this before they left).

I agree that it wasn't the best thing to say, but it isn't even untrue! She is a bit of a snob! At one point when we were all in the kitchen I saw her make a face because I used margarine in the mashed potatoes. I didn't see her eat any mashed potatoes at the table either so I know I'm not imagining it. My husband thinks I am making up scenarios to justify my behaviour but it's not true!

I just feel so frustrated because nobody is on my side and I feel like my mother-in-law considers my sister-in-law more of a family member than she does me. How is it not catty for her to go out and buy ingredients when staying at someone's house? My ingredients aren't good enough for her but I'm somehow the catty one?! It just feels really unfair and I don't think my husband has the right to upset with me. He's supposed to be on my side.","False","Asshole","5","41"
"ej9ibd","1578022327","AITA for telling my brother he can’t take my son hunting","My brother and I have always gotten along, even as kids. We never fought all that much, and even though we are drastically different people with drastically different interests we’ve always respected each others choices.

I’ve been vegetarian for almost 20 years now and while my brother doesn’t agree with it he’s never done more than joke with me a little about it. When I had my sons 12 years ago, everyone was aware they would be raised on a vegetarian diet. While I got the expected lecture from every other family member who thought that, even after I had been perfectly healthy for 8 years, my kids would grow up to be weak and unhealthy and I was basically abusing them, my brother had always had my back.

My nephew (brothers eldest son) is 14, and he’s been hunting with my brother for 2 years. For his 12th birthday my brother bought him his first gun. They enjoy doing it, and while I’ve obviously never been into hunting, I was glad to see they had an activity to do together. This year for Christmas, however, he got both my sons guns. My eldest (they are twins, but one came out first obviously lol) wanted nothing to do with it. He’s always been sensitive and told my brother that he didn’t want to use it. My youngest however was stoked. He was thrilled when he found out “gift of gun=hunting with his uncle”. I didn’t know if he knew what hunting was, so I explained to him very plainly that it meant he would be taking the gun he just got into the woods with his uncle to hunt and kill an animal. He seemed a little off put, but said he’d still like to go.

My brother did not discuss that he would be getting guns for my kids, and I was shocked when they opened them and honestly a little hurt. I don’t think it’s appropriate for a 12 year old, vegetarian or not, to be hunting. It always seemed like an “older kid” activity. I told my son and my brother that I would have to think about it. I ended up telling my brother this morning that I wasn’t comfortable with it. He was pretty upset, and didn’t understand what the big deal was. He even offered to take my son along with him but not let him actually use his gun, just so he could get to see what it really was all about. I haven’t told my son yet and I’m afraid I’ll disappoint him.

AITA for telling my brother I didn’t my want my son hunting, and WIBTA for telling my son I wouldn’t allow him to go with even if he wasn’t going to be shooting his gun?

Edit:spelling

Edit 2: I’ve decided that regardless of the final outcome, they will be participating in a hunter safety class. It will give them a good background if they go hunting. Both my sons will be taking it, even though my eldest doesn’t want anything to do with guns. I feel it’s important that they know how to be safe around guns even if they never end up touching them.

Edit 3: people are concerned with me having the guns in my home, but don’t worry my brother made it clear to everyone that they would be staying at his home in his locked gun cabinet at all times unless the boys are with him and they are shooting.

Edit 4: lol sorry for so many edits. First, I am their mom, not their dad. Second, my dads side of the family is full of hunters, most of the men hunt and a few women, too. So it’s not that they’ve never been around guns or hunting or anything like that, it’s just that they’ve (up until this point) gone with my beliefs.

"ej9oby","1578023125","AITA for feeling resentment toward a friend who's still friends with my sexual harrasser?","Honestly, I hope this is a situation where I'm just being sensitive and ITA.

Basically, I (23m) was sexually harassed by my ex-friend (23f) for a period of a few months a couple years ago. I didn't exactly directly call her out on it at the time, because a) I was younger and not super self-confident, and b) I didn't want to cause my group of friends to split up over this, or something like that. I only told her that I wasn't interested in her and acted very uncomfortable when she would start to come on to me. This went on for a few months before I finally had enough of her both making me feel like a piece of meat and also just being generally shitty to me, by doing a few things; including having sex with someone I told her I was interested in right after I told her. I don't want to get into too many other details because I know my friends all use reddit as well.

Essentially, it all came to a head when one night she got drunk and borderline groped me at a get together I was at after cussing me out. I basically had enough and cut all ties, even though she apologized profusely. After my mutual friends asked me what happened and I told them, they all believed me and especially one who witnessed some of this were very sympathetic and didn't want anything to do with her after this.

Except for my one friend, who is also one of my best friends. Directly after I told him what happened, he said it was awful what happened, but also said that even though she fucked up, he still considered her a good person, and said people make mistakes. He's an understanding guy, so I kind of get this to an extent. Regardless, he was still distant toward her after this. After a few months, he told me he was hanging out with her again, and asked me if I was ok with that. I don't remember exactly what I said but I didn't tell him no explicitly because I didn't know what to say. I just said I didn't understand why he still wanted to hang out with her knowing what she did, but I also said I didn't want to tell him what to do.

Ever since then, I've felt resentment toward this friend for still being friends with this person, knowing what she did. Whenever she's brought up in conversation, he acts like I shouldn't be so hard on her, which adds fuel to the fire. I honestly have no idea if this is a normal thing to be feeling or if I'm just being sensitive and selfish, hence this post.

Lots of alcohol was left over and since I'm not a big drinker, I set apart a couple nice liquors that I like and dropped the rest in my trunk (about 15 bottles of booze). 
Then today when I was driving around town a homeless man came to my window to beg for change, I didn't have any so I gave him a bottle of booze. The man was ecstatic, as this is a 20$ bottle of Scotch. We exchanged  new year's wishes and we were both on our way .

Then I thought it would be a nice gesture to give away that alcohol which I wouldn't drink anyway to people who are out in the cold and would cherish having a drink since most cannot afford it. I drove around downtown for an hour seeking out homeless people, giving them bottles of alcohol and wishing them happy new year.

When I shared the story with my friends and SO most of them reprimanded me telling me that many people who have ended up in the streets might be recovering addicts or alcoholics and that by giving them drinks I was actually not helping them. Although I considered this approach I find it to be patronising and presumptuous.

I’m gonna start out with I’m not the brightest bulb. I’ve just accepted it at this point, I’m a little slow. Never did well in school, basically autistic when I comes to social situations. I’ve tried different methods of getting better and it hasn’t helped much.

On to the story. My girlfriend introduced me to her parents today. She’s Asian, and so naturally I assumed that at least one of her parents would also be Asian. You know genetics and all that stuff. So I go in to their house and my girlfriend introduces me, and says “these are my parents” and said their names. I guess I had a dumb look on my face, and then said something kind of dumb, and said “these are your parents?” In like a questioning voice. I honestly didn’t connect the dots. 

My girlfriend says “I’m adopted” in an annoyed voice, and her parents are glaring at me. I quickly made an effort to apologize but the rest of the night was awkward.

When we got home my girlfriend ripped into me about how I should have been able to figure it out myself and that I shouldn’t have said that. I apologized again but I feel like she should have warned me beforehand? She knows I’m not the best at this kind of thing.

"eja0bh","1578024782","AITA for refusing to spend time with my mother over family disputes?","I (18M) am the youngest of 4 kids. There’s a large gap between me and the rest of them in age, the smallest being nine years between myself and my brother, P. By the time I was 8, all my siblings except P were out of the picture; my father worked far away and was rarely around, and my mother worked full time as well. As such, I spent a lot of time with P as a kid.

P was the youngest child for the first nine years of his life and had two masculine older sisters that picked on him quite a bit. I think this arrangement left him feeling emasculated and insecure in his masculinity. 

When I was left alone with P, he would constantly make demeaning comments that often centered around my masculinity. What I did or said would often be criticized as girly or effeminate. Whenever I showed any emotion, I would be referred to as a “drama queen.” He would also get a little rough — it was simple horseplay, like arm punching, but this happening between a 17 year old and an 8 year old is a little different. All of this led me to have severe issues with my own masculinity, especially when I failed to sexually mature as a teenager and developed gynecomastia due to a hypogonadism disorder. 

P and I haven’t spoken for several years now. However, he still hangs around the family home and lived there until recently. That means he’s still involved in the family, and has a close relationship with my mother. I’ve tried to tell her about his actions, but she never wants to hear it. She’s dismissive and constantly changes the subject.

My mother is sometimes strange, and can be very difficult to talk to about emotions. I had some pretty bad mood swings in high school, especially when I was 15/16. When I had long periods of sadness, my mother seemed to take personal offense to it. She would sometimes act irrationally, like punching a hole in my flimsy bedroom door or, in one humorous instance, throwing a brick of cheese at me as she cooked macaroni and cheese because she was cooking one of my favorite foods so I had no right to be sad. 

I am on winter break from college, and my mother wanted me to have dinner with her at a local restaurant we’ve talked about trying. However, after a round of P apologetics, I refused and told her to spend time with P, since she obviously favored him. She obviously was disappointed and claimed that I’m selfish and that she is unappreciated. She wants to have both of us in her life, but P is an awful person and her constant defense of him makes me want to have nothing to do with her. AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","5","6"

I'm a college student and I also work the morning stock shift at a store from 4-8 a.m. six days a week (every day except Sundays). It's not a super exciting job, but the pay is okay and it gives me the rest of the day free to concentrate on my classes and assignments. 

Three of my coworkers work the same early morning shift. One of them, Sandra, called me a few hours ago to tell me she was in a bad car accident this afternoon. Fortunately, she isn't hurt, but she said the car had extensive body damage and could be in the shop for up to two weeks. She asked me if I could please give her a ride to/from work until she can get it repaired. The store where we work is very strict about attendance and has a three strikes policy when it comes to missing shifts. There's no way she could miss two weeks of work and still keep her job. 

I'm the only person at our store who lives anywhere remotely near where Sandra lives. But even so, her home is in a rural area outside of the city limits (20 minutes from my apartment), and picking her up, taking her to work, taking her back home and then driving to my college would take an extra hour and a half each day. That is a BIG ask for two weeks. 

What makes me feel guilty is that she's really struggling financially right now and has a lot of medical debt she needs to pay off. I know she needs this job, and if I say no, I'm going to be indirectly responsible for causing her a lot of financial hardship.

"ejaawd","1578026283","WIBTA if I didn't go to my brother's wedding?","My brother (30's) and I (late 20's F) have never been close. He always picked on me when we were growing up and he never really grew out of it. We see each other maybe once a year on the holidays if he comes home and only talk on each others birthdays (well lets be honest, we text because that's how much we really care about each other, plus he didn't even text me on my birthday this year, I only got a ""happy belated birthday! Hope you had a fun weekend"" text almost a week later). I've tried to mend out relationship over the years and spend time with him doing things we both like, but he always end up pushing my buttons, ALL of them because he knows what ticks me off, and making me not want to spend time with him. 

Well my brother recently got engaged. Him and his fiance live on the other side of the country from me (literally the opposite coast), but both of their families live in the same state that I do. When they were originally talking about wedding dates and venues they wanted to get married in the state that I live at a venue that would be a 2-4 hour drive for most people. I was just told that they have officially decided to get married in the state that they live in, which means every single family member (parents, siblings, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc) will all have to fly, get a rental car, get a hotel for a weekend (oh, and the wedding is on a Friday), etc.

I'm thinking of not going for multiple reasons. 1) I have a school-aged child. The wedding would be during the school year so we would have to pull him out of school for at least 2 days, 2) Flights for the three of us would cost over $1,000 round trip in total, 3) A hotel room for the three of us would cost at least $500 for the weekend and we'd have to get a rental car, so all in we'd be at a minimum of $2,000 for the weekend. As stated above, I'm not close to my brother so I'm not sure I'm willing to pull my kid out of school and spend a couple thousand dollars to fly to the other side of the country to bear witness to a union for two people who I barely know (I've only met his fiance a handful of times, and while she's very nice and I do like her, I hardly know her).

My parents will likely be upset with me if I don’t go and I would feel like a bad daughter and sister if I didn’t go. I’m honestly torn on what to do.

We've got two fights recently and both of them stem from the issue of us having different values and expectations. In the end, everything was good to begin the New Year. 

That was until tonight, during our conversation of values she brought up smoking cigarettes. She used to smoke when she was in high school (3 years ago) and when I first met her. However she stopped a few months before her and I got together. 

To preface, I am against smoking. I think it's a big turn off for me for numerous reasons that I don't think need to be outlined. She knew this, when we first got together I revealed to her that I was glad that she had stopped smoking and that she's kept it up for so long. She was happy about it too. 

It's been almost a year since she's smoked, and tonight she asked how I'd feel if she were to smoke. The conversation went something like this:

Her: ""What if I smoked?""

Me: ""I don't like smoking.""

Her: ""That doesn't answer the question,""

Me: ""..well I wouldn't be happy with it if..""

Her: ""Why'd you have to think about it?""

Me: ""Because I want to say it properly without upsetting you.""

Her: ""So you wouldn't like it if I smoked?""

Me: ""No, I think it would change the way I feel about you.""

Her: ""That upsets me,""

Me: ""Why?""

She then went on telling me that it was shallow to have feelings change over something like that, and that it upsets her that my love isn't unconditional. I explained that I don't think it's shallow to do such a thing, it's a health risk and a money pit. She turned it and said that if I were to get fat she wouldn't ever leave me. We briefly argued over whether these two are the same thing at all, it ended with her huffing and ignoring me for the rest of the evening.

She went home briefly after. She's sent me a text proclaiming that my view makes me an asshole. I was baffled, I thought this was all hypothetical. I don't understand her behaviour at all. I'm firm on my stance, smoking is disgusting and if she were to take up smoking again it would jeopardize our relationship.

She blew up the house group chat about this dog and told us she left it in the backyard while she went to work. I was at work myself when I started getting the texts.

I get home hours later and the dog is no where to be found in the backyard. I hear it later barking in the house and I thought it was coming from a different roommate's room who was home. (Turns out it was in the 1st roommates room but I didn't realize this until later). This dog is barking non-stop. So I'm thinking it can't stay the night bc 1) my LL has told us she has a no tolerance policy for pets and 2) it's making too much noise.

No one in my house has made any attempts to find the owner and at this point it is 7pm at night. So first I search animal shelters to see if any were still open and I can't find any. So then I call the non emergency police line and explain the situation. I also text the group chat to let them know what I was doing. 45 min later, they send out an officer to pick up the dog and say they're going to check for a micro ship. Ok fine all good, situation taken care of, no problems. 

Now the 1st roommate is blowing up my phone, calling me a dog murderer, telling me off for going into her room (I didn't go in, I cracked the door and the dog came running out), and telling me it wasn't my responsibility and I shouldn't have gotten involved. Then she told me way after the fact that the LL was aware of the situation. Why she didn't tell us this in the beginning or why she didn't say anything when I messaged her, I have no clue.

My position is: she told the entire house about it and made it seem like she wanted our help. She didn't tell us the LL was ok with it. She left the dog alone and went off to work.

since they found out we were dating they've wanted me to come over often. now they’ve invited me to christmas, new years, and sunday get togethers. they've talked to me about how we'll be married soon and have kids (bleh). not only that but it might be because I'm a grown man, but they treat me like a child, which just seems to be the norm for girls :/.  it's caused so much stress that today I had a breakdown over text. one of the major reasons I even go over there is because I know if I dont go during big days my bf could get his ass beat by his folks, and I know they won't if im there. so I put up with it and go over, but most other days he's fine, so I don't want to go.

my bf hates my folks. they make us run errands when we are in the middle of things, they berate me to the point where my bf call them bullies now, and they are also just huge drunks. My house is also smaller and less stocked food wise, and he just in general find my folks annoying. our other place to hang out is a comic book shop that lets us play on their multiple consoles, but it’s also filled with loud and unpleasant people that he can’t deal with.

he has a habit of just coming and picking me up without me knowing where we're going. today when he texted me I asked him where we were going, once I found out it was at his house, I said no. I apologized and he just responded ""sure"", which sent me into that before mentioned breakdown. later once I cooled down I apologized for that and brought up how i've just been stressed, he didn't know what was stressing me and I said his folks, which when I said ""Idk its weird"" he also said ""yeah"". two hours later he said that he just wants to play games. he also had a group of our friends over, and I know that they tend to leave us alone more when a group is there.

me: ""I mean no but personally I prefer that than being called a girl and getting the most painful thing in my life shoved in my face.""

bf: ""it's the one place I can actually be comfortable""

bf: ""okay you know what okay sorry.""

me: ""if you really want me to come I will since they aren't going to bother us.""

When we met over 10 years ago we went out drinking a couple weekends a month. When we had our first child 7 years ago, neither of us drank, unless it was a date night. About 2 years ago he started drinking more and more until it was an every night thing. Sometimes it’s one or two beers. More recently, it’s around 4-5, sometimes more to the point where he blacks out. He’s mean when he drinks and incredibly stupid. I grew up trapped with an alcoholic father and made it clear to my husband early on in our relationship that I would not live with another alcoholic again. The last year has been hard. I tell him I’m divorcing him and he promises to cut back on drinking or stop completely. That lasts for a few days and he’s right back to square one. I’m trapped. I’ve been a stay home mother for 3 years and was injured a few months ago (nearly paralyzed) and am unable to return to work at the moment because the doctor says my only physical movement should be walking. (It was my spine injured, so no sitting, bending, leaning, twisting, lifting etc.) I have no money, nowhere I could stay, nothing. I know it has been hard on my husband. He had to take on so much responsibility when I was injured. But I’ve been better for a couple months now. I can care for the home and kids as well as I did before. Yet he’s still drinking on a daily basis to the point of being drunk and has been missing work. His family are heavy drinkers and see nothing wrong with the behavior. One of his family members even told me that since he is the provider for our family, he should be able to drink as much as he wants, whenever he wants. The scariest part is he will drink and drive, which I am vehemently against! I drink maybe 6-7 times a year, get drunk maybe once a year. I enjoy smoking weed after the kids have gone to bed. I’ll enjoy half a bowl, watch some TV, take a shower and go to bed. My husband thinks it’s unfair that he has to moderate/stop drinking while I continue to smoke weed.

I (27f) have a best friend (27f) who is needy, bipolar and acts out sexually. That's summing up A LOT but thats not the issue at hand. This just past new years eve, she did what I think is a breaking point for me and I need to know if I'm the asshole for cutting her out of my life. 

I have a really sweet work friend (28f) who has been single for a long time and is super picky about who she is into because of her past. She and my friend (Jane) have become friends and we three have hung out together and it's been great. Jane has two kids and my work friend (julie) has taken them out for icecream and has just been an all around very kind person to both of us. Julie expressed interest in my boyfriends best friend and I said I could arrange for us all to hang out casually sometime. This friend (Dylan) has slept with my best friend in the past and they are both crazy and it didn't work out. So I tried to arrange a casual hang out but it didnt work out until new years eve. I asked my friend Jane to be cool, and to be kind and just step out of the way so they could at least meet with no pressure. She said absolutely, she loves Julie and wants her to be happy and she has no feelings for Dylan as he was just a casual fling and agreed to it several times before new years. She promised me she would be selfless and let Julie hang with him no problems. 
We all went out for new years and immediately Jane is all over Dylan. Not like kissing but demanding his attention. She literally cannot not be wanted. She was incredibly fake to Julie and said all of these kind things to her all night but followed dylan around like a puppy. We had an afterparty at my house where jane pulled me into the bathroom and said she was going home with Dylan. I begged her not to because it was cruel to do that to Julie who has been nothing but nice to her but Jane said julie should have been more aggressive and she wants to get laid. She ended up leaving with him and her and I got into a massive fight the next day because I genuinely think what she did was super selfish and self serving to a very kind person. I feel like if she could do that to someone as nice as Julie, she isn't a good person. She accused me of slut shaming and called me a cunt.

Just before we leave, his mum tells us to pick up a shirt for him because he didn't have one. I'm confused, because he had the opportunity to go shopping this morning but didn't, and now we are being made to get him a shirt. He's not even coming with us to get it.

GF and I lived together and had fairly traditional roles for the time in terms of finances.  We split rent/bills evenly and because of work/school schedules we generally did our own thing food wise. Beyond that, when we were out doing ""couple things"" I paid for everything; restaraunt dining, night out at the bar with friends,  vacations (I had just paid everything for a short 2-3 day trip a couple weeks before this argument). There was never any specific talk about who pays for what and I certainly wouldn't have insisted that I had to be the one who paid for all the outside the house stuff, that's just kinda the way it was.


One day we're sitting around and kinda out of the blue she started telling me that she didn't think it was fair that I didn't contribute to the cost of her birth control pills and that I was having sex for free, while she had to pay for it and she wanted me to start paying for half. I asked her if she was going to start paying for half of all of the other couple related things we did that I covered and she seemed a little taken aback by the suggestion, but a day or 2 later agreed that she would start paying for half of everything.

In that day or 2 time, while the argument was still going on, I decided that while on one hand I had no need to pay for everything from some kind of male control perspective, I also didn't think I wanted to be in a relationship where every penny had to be counted and divided evenly for every little thing and that's the direction it seemed we were heading. I just didn't /don't care enough about money to make it such an issue. FWIW we both came from fairly middle class families, although her parents were more affluent than mine. At this time she received financial assistance from her parents, I received little to none from mine and we both had fairly low paying jobs being in school at the time.

Ultimately we broke up shortly after this and while it wasn't specifically because of this argument, it was probably a sign (among many) that we just weren't as compatible as we would have hoped.

I'd picked her up hitch hiking one day. Not realising she was in the group. It has a rotating set of people. We played different types of games.

We got to talking a little the next day. About 6 months of nothing more than small talk. She wanted to head out, grab some food and watch some sports. I was down. It was a fine evening.

She brought up being friends with benefits the next day. I told her that wasn't my style and I'm ether all in or not when it comes to being intimate with someone.

We organised to go to my house for a movie afternoon and after coming up with 2-3pm for her to come on over before her obligations later in the evening so we could get a couple of movies down, eat some popcorn. You get it.

At 5:45 she finally called me saying she was going to be their soon. I had messaged her around 2:30 to see if we where still on. But had left it at that.

I'll freely admit I was short with her. I had been left hanging for hours, no clue what was going on. I told her I has other things to do and left it there.

I messages about an hour later, apologising for being angry/blunt. That I felt I had being jerked around and it had been an issue to even pin down a time.

She had messed up an appointment taking her dog to the vet at 1:30, knew it was the plan. She didn't believe I should be informed about the dog. I said it wasn't about the dog. But I'd have helped out if I would have known and it was being left hanging for close to 4 hours that had been my issue. I heads up at some point felt fair.

A few hours later I surgested we called it a wash and try again. And that I had been looking forward to a movie night with her.

So 2 messaged from me and 1 from her about the evening and 1 calling it a wash. It's important later.

Ended up having a movie night. Was a disaster. Couldn't get though any scenes in the movie without questions, I'd never seen it ether. She didn't seem interested in the movie had offered no alternative to what she'd like to watch and was wholly uninterested. I decided a relationship wasn't going to happen.

Kept the normal small talk at the boardgames and had lent her some tools.

The other day she messages me. She said even if we didn't work out sexualy. She still wanted to hang out. I, rather bluntly to be fair, said I hadn't been up for fwb and not really up for hanging out.

She began saying she's lost interest after the long string of dramatic text after the movie evening and that I'd sent her a bomdment of messages.

I looked back at the messages and time stamps and called bullshit. The messages where long ish. But only 2(7:15 to 7:30) ones working through the problems of the day and a final one to try again some other time (around 10)

A little backstory: My older brother has a friend named Ash (Not his real name but what he wants everyone to call him)

I don't like Ash, for many reasons, one being he acts like a total DICK and is honestly kinda rude, I know he isn't always like this. I really wish I could say me and Ash got along, but me being like 3 almost 4 years younger then him, not knowing him irl and being really reserved with my brothers friends, I just don't... He's an ass to me.

&#x200B;

So a couple of my friends online had been playing with Ash and my older brother, my older brother got off and gave me the console, I join the party with my friends and Ash and pretty soon I make a new party for me and my friends. 

The 3 of us get to talking and they say how they don't like Ash, he's kinda rude. So me and my friends are having a conversation about our mutual dislike of Ash, nothing rude, no shit talking was involved on my end.

But, my brother comes out of no where and says ""You know Ash is coming here for the summer right?"" 

To which I reply ""I honestly don't care, he's YOUR friend, and I'm not obligated to interact with him""

I end up repeating this in multiple different ways, it got to the point of me asking him to leave me alone so I could play my game and my dad having to make him leave the room.

So fast forward a few days and He's calling me to the living room because ""Ash wants to talk to you""

I ask why, and he says ""I told him you were shit-talking him behind his back""

To which I reply ""I wasn't though! I was having a conversation with MY friends about how we don't like YOUR friend""

IDK if he had misheard me or just wanted to twist my words to make his friend mad at me.

But Ash legit scares me, because of his home life he doesn't take shit and I know if I make ONE wrong move he's either going to insult me or worse. I am a very insecure person so it's a HUGE fear of mine.

My brother doesn't understand why he scares me, because my brother isn't easily scared. I get gut feelings about people and they usually turn out correct in the end and my gut keeps telling me I shouldn't let my guard down around this guy.

anyways I refused to talk to Ash and I went and made sure my parents knew what was going on.

They knew I don't like Ash and they know he's mean to me and that he scares me.

"ejbe1j","1578032121","WIBTA if I don't ask my twin to be my Maid of Honor, or even to be in my wedding at all?","  

My boyfriend (23m) and I (23f) have been dating since high school. We are what you would call “engaged to be engaged”. We’re already wedding planning; he just hasn’t proposed yet.

One of the topics of this planning is my twin sis, “Aly”. I love Aly. She’s my only sister and we used to be incredibly close. She is also very narcissistic. Here is one thing she’s done that exemplifies this aspect of her personality:

When I was 20, my bf and I had a drunken toss in the hay, and I ended up pregnant. We agreed due to our financial situation to terminate the pregnancy. We left town to do it & it went smoothly, but I was emotional for months after. We kept it on the down-low, I only told my mom, and stupidly, Aly. After we got back, I was in her dorm room and Aly told me she’d had a “drunken one-night stand” and had taken 6 pregnancy tests. According to her, “2 were positive and 4 weren’t”. She told our parents & her friends & was making a huge deal about it. She got her blood-work results while I was in her dorm, & she wasn’t pregnant. Shocker. She called our mom and cried about how she was “devastated that she now doesn’t get to make the choice” about whether to abort or not. She said this in my presence, 3 days after I had terminated my REAL pregnancy. She called me selfish & said I was “making everything about me” when I got upset at this and left. I didn’t speak to her for months after this, & I think this is when our relationship started to deteriorate, as she never apologized & I never forgave her.

Since then we have had a rocky relationship. She had a horrid bf(he got them both fired & sued for 10k by their ex-boss). Last summer she begged me to help her “escape” him. I let her move in & helped her re-enroll in school. The first time she borrowed my car, she totaled it. This car was my first adult purchase & I had saved for MONTHS to afford it. Gone within a week of her moving in. She no longer lives with me.

I want to add that I’m not trying to make myself out as a perfect person. I have absolutely said & done shitty things to her & she could write a whole post about how awful I am, which would be fair. We are just the most TOXIC people on this planet for each other. 

She expects to be my Maid of Honor. I don’t even want her in my wedding at all. My mom says at the end of the day, we are twins & not having her in the wedding would cause irreparable damage.

I say our relationship already has irreparable damage. I have friends who are closer to me than my sister, & who care about my well-being more than Aly ever has. I want to be surrounded by my friends who are my true soul sisters, rather than the sister I have who revels in my failure. (My bf is in 100% agreement).

So what do you think? WIBTA if I don’t ask Aly to be my MOH, or be in my wedding at all?

tldr: sister & I have a bad relationship, I don't want her as my MOH or to be in my wedding, my mom thinks I WBTA if I don't have her in the wedding, while bf& I don't think she deserves the ""honor"".","False","Not the A-hole","5","44"

Because I work seasonal job(s) with no real options for OT, money is always tight around the holidays. Nonetheless, I still try and snag gifts for the other five people I celebrate with (mom, bro/SIL, their two boys). 

This past year before Christmas, there was a group text asking us to cough up cash to help cover the Christmas breakfast; in the past, they would just ask me to bring something. Additionally, I found out as I was finishing my Christmas list that they had declined to get me anything (which also happened the year prior).

Now, I know Christmas is not about the gifts or how much you spend and all that... but... They(bro/SIL) dropped hundreds of dollars in gifts on the children and even managed to pick up something for mom, but couldn't afford to get me anything. Also, breakfast wasn't spectacular and they didn't really share the details of said breakfast when they started asking for donations. All in all, I felt like I had to pay to participate in a family gathering I had little say in.

I guess I feel that my family is being thoughtless/dishonest, and I definitely would have been better off financially if I had not gotten them gifts, but I did anyway, cause that's what you do.

All of these postings include beef, which my mom is desperate for and my SIL doesn’t eat. So, after a week of being here and cooking nonstop it was nothing my SIL would eat.

Today however, I made a steak in mushroom and wine gravy that she could eat for a few months and made extra for my kids. I asked my brother if he would eat some and he said he would only eat what his wife would eat and it was unfair that I cooked all these meals that his wife couldn’t eat.

"ejbid6","1578032817","AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to take me for a day to Miami while we are on a family vacation to Orlando?","I along with my family and boyfriend are and live in Lima, Peru. This situation regards me \[M-23\], my boyfriend \[M-23-5yr relationship\], and my family (mom, dad, younger sister).

My family recently owns a house in Orlando which we haven't seen before (only my parents).

As 2019 started to come to an end, my mother told me that she was planning a 10-day vacation to Orlando. My childhood was pretty much built there after all, and my parents found a nice deal for the international flight tickets.

As this decision was being made, Christmas was approaching and so I was thinking of what to gift my boyfriend. My family loves my boyfriend btw. Given that his birthday is in April, the trip itself is in March, and he loves to travel, I thought to join both Christmas and Birthday presents one and buy him a ticket to Orlando to come along with us. My parents were totally on board.

When I told him about the trip he went completely ecstatic. He loved it.

My parents started to plan things. However, things started to turn sour when my boyfriend suggested Miami. Here's the thing, his mother's friend (an aunt) lives there as well as a school friend of his. A couple of years ago we went to Miami and stayed at his aunt's house and had a day to visit that same friend of his. Now that we were going to Orlando, he thought it wouldn't hurt to rent a car for a day to go to Miami and back that very night. He says we can have a great time, visit them and maybe go to one of the malls there and just have a day.

I wasn't on board for the following:

* **It's supposed to be a family trip**
* I don't have the money to spend on renting a car for just a day
* Going from Orlando to Miami takes up 3:30 hours each way. I remember doing it once and swore never to do that again in my life.
* He offered to drive, but even then it seems like we'll barely have any time at all for everything he wants to do. These are two very different people he wants to meet with who are already quite apart from each other even in Miami as it is.
* It just seems like a waste of a day on this vacation that has been actually hard to achieve.

We had a big discussion. He threatened to go with or without me. I told my mother and she, who's never been mad with him before, was furious, she even went as far as saying ""maybe this should have stayed a family trip with just the four of us to begin with"".

He felt very entitled to the situation, after all, I **had** given him the plane ticket as a present, meaning that he could really do whatever he pleases if he really wanted to. I explained how this was a family trip and he was being included and it should be somewhat expected of him to go with us. This doesn't mean that we can't do what we want, just stay in the same city at least...

He agreed but was very mad about the whole situation. And so I told my friends and they told me he was being the asshole and he told his friends and, of course, I was the asshole on that situation.

"ejbijj","1578032845","AITA for expecting a bite of my boyfriend's burrito?","Get ready for a petty AITA with my boyfriend. We are otherwise happy and I love his stupid ass. So I (24F) was staying over at my boyfriend’s (24M) place and I made it very clear to him that I was pretty hungry. For background I am a big sharer - I always buy him stuff when I pick up or make food. I also go out of my way to save the remainder of any food I eat for him even though I’d be down to eat it later.

Anyways, before I agreed earlier in the day to drive over around 8 pm, I made it very apparent that I hadn't eaten since 11 am and was very hungry/needed to eat. When I got there we hung out for a little, after which he proceeded to heat up half of his leftover burrito (and didn’t say anything addressing my hunger, or even his for that matter). He then started GOING TO TOWN on the burrito and I was a little hangry-induced peeved.

With two bites left he half heartedly offered me a bite (he admitted later it was indeed a half hearted offer). I said no I’m good due to the reason above. He proceeded to take it down in well under a minute. We sat around for at least 2 minutes after the burrito demolition while I was still noticeably peeved. After noticing my non-characteristic annoyance he offers to make me some freezer tacos. I accepted them somewhat begrudgingly and got in a better mood once I was full and forgot about it. This good mood lasted for a while until yesterday when he brought it up two months later.

This came up randomly on a flight yesterday when I was hangry. His argument is that it’s his burrito and he can do whatever he wants with it. My argument is that even though he knew I was super hungry, he chose to eat his precious burrito in front of me when he could've easily A) made food/communicated that he would make food for at the same time or B) genuinely offered me a bite of burrito before actually feeding me. We are both sticking to our guns. This isn’t super consequential, but I am such a AITA lurker and would love to get opinions, AITA?

Edit: Want to add a few things I missed. 

When we talked on the phone on my way over he said that he’d feed me.

Also I just reread the post and I totally made it seem like this is an actual argument. Neither of us care and we both think the situation is funny.","1578086887.0","Asshole","7","57"

Today it was raining and dan asked me at a meeting if i could help him out by taking him in for 4 before going to a residential rehab program. I called my parents (I’m 18m and live with them) and asked if we could help him out in anyway and they said no, so I ended up just driving him to buy him food somewhere about a mile away, at which point my parents started frantically calling and freaking out about driving a homeless man. They told me to stop driving so I did and they drove to me and met me at a Publix. My mom gave him 20$ and forced him to go out in the rain and leave, so I couldn’t even drive him back to the aa meeting spot where all of his possessions were.

I went to a Chinese food place inside a grocery store to get dinner for everyone. Ordered quart and 2 pint sized entrees. Guy seemed annoyed when I asked for the 3 bbq pork in separate containers but it was for 3 different people. Ordered 2 pint sized entrees and once again he seemed annoyed and only got one of them so I asked for one more and this is where it went downhill. 

I couldn’t understand much of what he was saying other than I.D. and not getting the last entree. He kept saying something about pay and pointing at the bakery/coffee shop area. I thought maybe he misheard me so I repeated that I needed 1 more pint sized entree. He grunted and got it but wouldn’t give it to me and asked for the basket with the other food.I hand it to him, he takes it over to the lady at the bakery said something to her and came back to me, shoo’d me off to the bakery and started helping someone else. He was extremely rude the whole time and I was fed up so I told the bakery lady I don’t want it. He came back over yelling when I started walking away and after some deciphering between the two of us apparently he wanted the bakery lady to escort me to the checkout to pay for the food. He said he’ll call the cops if I leave without paying or I’ll be banned forever for stealing. Keep in mind the guy ahead of me ordered 5 combination plates that were $8.99 each and the guy right after me ordered 2 $8.99 plates, $7.99 bag of chicken and a huge sushi tray I don’t know the cost of but all of that was more than mine. Neither of those 2 got questioned or escorted to the checkout, the people after me weren’t told to get escorted either. After getting inaudibly yelled at and watching several people get their food with no problems, I walked out and left. I didn’t get loud or cause a scene, I simply said “you can keep the food, I don’t want it anymore.” 

If they were having problems with people stealing and implemented a new checkout policy I wouldn’t have contested but I didn’t like how rude he was or the fact out of a group of people I was the one and only told to do something different over a measly $25 worth of chinese. After I came home with no food, explained the situation, she asked why. I said I don’t know but pointed out race and age were the only differences... my grandma rolled her eyes and said I’m overreacting and don’t complain when prices go up assuming I’m even allowed back in the store. Now she wants me to go back there tomorrow after work and compensate them for the food I wasted but I don’t feel like I did anything wrong.. The guy was really rude and had no reason to act like that or isolate me from everyone else. AITA in this situation ?

TL;DR rude grocery store chinese employee singled me out and wanted the bakery to escort me to the checkout line over $25 worth of food to which I refused.

"ejbpzp","1578034045","AITA for declining to repair my grandmother bathroom that my aunt destroyed and then making them “cry”","Backstory: My grandma and aunt raised me. My aunt is a jobless shut in and has been that way her entire life. Lives with my grandma and mooches off her, the government, and other family members to make ends meet. She’s about to turn 50 and has never been gainfully employed.

As a present to my grandmother when I got a job after my doctorate program I redid her entire room for her because it was falling part. She’s worked hard her entire life to raise her 4 kids and me. She deserves the world and more and this was the least I could do now that I have a stable income. I did all the work myself and was frugal about it. new wall paint, decent IKEA furniture, and laid down some vinyl tiling, and a new mattress. Maybe $600 total to say thank you to her. 

After this my aunt started getting loony thinking I’d be helping with house repairs. She started asking me to do things and I would decline saying I don’t have money for that. Now on a visit home for New Years she brings me into my grandmothers bathroom and she took it upon HERSELF to sledgehammer the ENTIRE bathtub tiled area down to the cement fucking backers. She said she did it so she could investigate why the water stopped running as hard. And she expected ME to chip in to not only fix the water flow issues but to help pay for putting the tile back up.

I have never been so livid in my life. I told her she had no business laying a hand on a house that she in no way owns and even worse to assume I’d be helping her with unnecessary cosmetic repairs. I even said I have no interest in helping with the plumbing because this is NOT how you treat loved ones. To make it worse this was my second time bringing my boyfriend home to them and they pull this embarrassing shit. I said goodbye to them and dragged him the hell out.

Anyways I get a call from my grandma trying to guilt trip me saying I shouldn’t have acted that way and made my aunt cry when I left. If I would have stayed any longer I would have definitely made
 her cry because I would have laid out some hard fucking truths about her life I won’t
Get into.

Anyways. I don’t give a rats ass about my aunts feelings. I’m mostly pissed my grandma has had her bathroom destroyed against her will and has to get ready in dilapidated mess now. Now I have 200k in student loans I’m trying to pay down ASAP. If I wanted to I could pay for an entire crew to come in a redo the entire bathroom over the weekend. But I’m very frugal and I’m trying my hardest to get rid of my loans so I can invest in  my own life. Hell When I redid her room I did it myself by hand. But I have neither the time, energy, or knowledge to redo bathroom tile on my own.

And I do not want to set the precedent that I’ll be swooping in to fix every issue that comes up with their house and any stupid shit my aunt decides to destroy.

Am I the asshole in this situation? Should I be lending as much help as I can afford? I feel like if I help out her I’ll just be enabling future shit behavior.","1578041241.0","Not the A-hole","1548","205"

GF and I are both busy with college apps, I was out of town-- we didn’t talk much in this period.

Note: GF likely suffers from depressive episodes at times and blocks/ignores me during episodes.

NYE party together

She doesn’t pay much attention to me even though she hasn’t seen me in a while (tried to not overthink)

Text her good morning next day, ignored. I let it be

Call later, she’s working on college apps and will call later. Doesn’t call, so I call after midnight (when apps were due)-- She answers, say she isn’t feeling well and wants to go to sleep. I feel ignored, but I realized it isn’t a fair assumption

she usually isn’t distant so I text her asking if she’s upset. I notice she’s active on instagram. At this point I feel like it’s rational to feel ignored because she’s on phone but not responding to me. It escalates in my mind and i text her:

*“Idk whats going on youve been so distant*

*Idk if im just overthinking but it’s really been stressing me out*

*What’s going on? I’m freaking out right now*

*Why are you avoiding me*

*I really hope I’m overreacting and I’m sorry if I am*

*But idk whats going on and it really seems like ur not talking to me for some reason and its a really bad feeling”*

Note: I probably shouldn’t have blown her phone up with texts but I was trying to communicate.

She doesn’t respond so I sleep

Next morning I call, no answer.

I text:

“I’m concerned about your wellbeing because this isnt typical of you” ( I was worried about a potential episode)

No response

an hour later I text her friend to ask if she’s okay and she says she’ll text my GF. GF’s friend gets back to me INSTANTLY and says that *“she’s fine and trying to do her work-- dont bother her”*

I get upset she instantly responds to her friend but not at all to me

I text her this which might be the part where IATA but keep in mind I thought she was ghosting me:

*“I really deserve a brief response crazy that I had to go through another person*

*Really sucks when you care about someone and then you try to talk to them bc they’re acting differently towards you and ur really worried but it turns out ur just being a nuisance*

*It’s cool I’ll stop bothering you”*

3 hours later she responds:

*GF: that was super unhealthy and toxic*

*Me: Sorry*

*GF:* ***I should be able to turn on do not disturb*** *for a few hours to finish my apps that are due by the end of the day*

*Me: I got worried and it escalated, ur right*

*GF: without feeling guilty like i did something??*

*Me: I thought you were intentionally ignoring me though, I’m sorry*

She gets upset that I guilt tripped her and says I treated her poorly and now she won’t talk to me

flooding her with texts is an immature way to handle it but I was freaking out because it seemed like she was either in a depressive episode or ghosting me. The thing is she put me on do not disturb for 2 days without giving me any heads up or better yet just telling me not to interrupt her in the 1st place.

"ejbywe","1578035550","AITA for kissing my friend’s ex at midnight on New Years?","Throwaway account here. I know the title sounds awful but the situation is not what you may think. Bit of background, I (22F) have two friends I’ve known for several years now, we’ll call them Robert (22M) and Mandy (22F). Robert and Mandy dated for two years, and broke up our freshman year of college. Before the breakup, I was much closer to Mandy than Robert. But after the breakup happened, Mandy and I did not see each other often because of our schedules, but Robert became closer with me and some of our other friends. This breakup and everything occurred three years ago (early 2017). 

A few months after the breakup, Mandy and I were able to start hanging out and be close again. Since then, we have become super close and always spend so much time together. Robert of course knows all of this, as we are also very close. In the past, I have talked to him about my friendship and closeness with Mandy and wanted to see how he felt about it. I wanted him to make sure he knew I wasn’t taking sides and that I value my friendship with both of them. Robert told me he had absolutely no issue with it and the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind. He is a very laid back and simple guy, and so everything was settled with that situation. Robert has told me in the past several times that he is well over their situation and has moved on, and they have interacted since then and are civil with each other. He also currently has a girlfriend of one year. 

Here’s what happened. On New Year’s Eve, I went out with Mandy and some friends. We rang in the New Year at a bar, where of course none of us were sober. Before midnight, Mandy and I casually agreed that if we didn’t have anyone to kiss, we would just be each other’s kisses for the New Year, because we have kissed before while drunk in a joking way and it is not a big deal to us. So midnight comes around, and we don’t have anyone to kiss, so Mandy and I give each other a quick kiss and laugh and continued on. I took a quick video of it and we decided to post it to my snapchat story. Like I said before, a kiss was not a big deal to us at all, because we’re girlfriends and that stuff can casually happen between friends when having a night out, especially on New Year’s. So we clearly didn’t think anything of it, nor did we care about it being posted on my story. 

Robert viewed my story shortly after that happened. And since then, he has not been talking to me. We talk/snap everyday and since before midnight on New Years, he has not sent or said anything to me. I asked him a couple of times today if something is up and if everything is okay, and he has been leaving me on opened and on read. This isn’t like him, he’s never ignored me or frankly anyone like this before, and the only possible thing I can think of is the video of me and Mandy kissing. If this is the case, I obviously never intended for it to hurt him, but I have no idea for sure what the case is.

During this time my sister and I learned how to grow up fast and had to manage money and finances as my moms deployment was no where near over.

I'm forty years old, never been married, and never had children.  When I was younger, I dreamed of a husband and a family of my own, but a chance for that life was taken away from me twenty years ago.  That was the day when my SO, the love of my life and who I thought I would spend the rest of my life with, suddenly passed away.  He was my everything, my soulmate, my sun and stars, and his passing left me heartbroken.  Over the years, I tried dating other people and therapy but it never works.  It's like some piece inside me is broken and always will be.  It's like a piece of me died with him.

While my family tried to support me in the beginning, their presence in my life became less and less over time.  I have so many brothers and sisters and they drifted away from me as the years passed.  They all have their own lives.  I was never the favorite.  My mother went so far as to say she thought I'd be over his death by now.

My youngest sibling, my sister, is twenty-one and will be getting married soon.  Everyone, parents, brothers, and sisters are badgering me about going to the wedding.  I have to be there to support the youngest member.  But I can't bring myself to go.  It's already been painful having to live through twenty years of seeing my siblings and friends get to live out my dream when all I have left at the end of a day is a broken heart and an empty future.  I am afraid that I will end up dying alone with nothing to show for it.

I told my sister that I just can't come and now everyone is ganging up on me.  My parents think that it is selfish that I won't attend when I did for everyone else.  They think I should be over my SO by now, even when I know I never will me.  Just the idea of my sister, the same age I was when he died, getting to live the dream I had always hoped for myself is enough to make me break down.

But why should I put myself through that torture?  I love my sister with all my heart, but I can't bear to go to another wedding knowing that I never got my chance.

Earlier last night I was FaceTiming her and my sister (19f) came home. I don’t have a room so any FaceTime call I make is going to be public as I sleep in the living room. It was brought up that my sister had a doctors appointment and I pointed out that she had to take my brother (21m) to court tomorrow about a parking ticket. My sister started claiming that she never made that commitment despite the fact that she had. The girl I’m seeing we’ll call her Siri, piped in and started telling my sister about how she had made this commitment and began arguing with her calling her a garbage human and telling her she can’t even take care of her dogs. 

Everything she said was true and tbh my sister is pretty garbage. She does things like leaving her dogs locked in a cage or tiny room for days on end while she goes out and parties and forces my dad to care for her. At another point she took X while babysitting an infant child with her boyfriend. But that’s beside the point. 

This girl that I’ve been seeing and had insisted when she first met my sister that I should keep the peace and try to maintain my relationship with her and was generally very against arguing, got extremely worked up and told me she would fly me home tomorrow because she doesn’t want me to spent another minute in the house with my sister. She would pay for me to get to the airport, the ticket, and pick me up and I would just spend the week with her. That was tempting but I told her no because I wanted to see my family and I already had a commitment two days later and am unwilling to break my word when I give it.

Just before Christmas, her oldest brother (32M) got into an argument with his parents which resulted in his temporary living conditions becoming very much up in the air. It was just before the holidays, mind you, and my roommate and I are both very family oriented, so when he asked if he could crash on our couch, she and I agreed. 

I feel bad because I think he was trying to do his best, but he'd make comments about how clean it is in the apartment (we have three cats, it's clean, but lived in), or how my roommate is doing something wrong (disparaging comments about her weight or what she eats or why she isn't cooking dinner). 

New Year's Eve rolls around, he's still on our couch, switching between our place and his other sister's for the lease's sake... my roommate left for work early that morning, and I got up, did my business, and in the interim, the brother left the house. So, I locked up and went on my merry way. 

I found out later that he'd left the keys inside and just left the door unlocked, which I had then locked. He blamed my roommate and I was out forty bucks for a quick cab ride back to unlock the door for him. 

He's in a bad spot; he lost his job, he's on the outs with his folks-- rough, right? I feel badly because my roommate and I agreed that he needed to go. All of his negativity towards my roommate, the house, in addition to drinking an entire bottle of very expensive rum we'd been saving for a special occasion, in addition to all of our wine and the ""replacement"" whiskey he'd bought for us on NYE-- it was too much. 

I feel badly because it's so obvious that he's in a bad place right now, I just don't think there was anything else we could do.

"ejc9ne","1578037522","WIBTA for confronting my mother that took a picture of me and my SO in our delivery room?","A little background for context:

Back when I was about 7 months pregnant I let my mother know that I did not want anyone besides my fiance in the delivery room with me. My mother is a very emotional person, so I let her know in the mist gentle, kind way possible. She said she was disappointed but generally took it well. 
About a month ago (almost 9 months pregnant) she asked about it to see if I had changed my mind. I firmly said no, that I wouldn't be changing my mind, and on the off-chance I did change my mind during delivery that I would let her know (this seems kind of rude but my mom tends to try to guilt trip me into doing things I otherwise would be uncomfortable with).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I have my baby. She was escorted out of the room when the delivery started and was welcomed back about an hour after I delivered. A few hours later she shows me a picture taken outside of the room and through the little window of the door. It's a picture of me and my fiance looking down at our newborn. And while it's admittedly cute, I couldn't help but get irritated when she said in a joking manner, ""I was able to sneak a picture of you guys even though I wasn't allowed in, not my fault the nurse moved the curtain so I could see you!""

I feel like she's just brushing it off and trying to make the whole thing like a joke, but it really rubs me the wrong way. I haven't done anything yet but I feel kind of guilty for being so bothered by it. I dont mean to seek validation I genuinely feel like I might be taking my wishes for privacy too far? It's hard to tell because she frequently tries to guilt me into doing whatever she wants.

"ejca5n","1578037612","AITA if (my husband and) I buy a $4000 tent trailer while living with a family member for who only charges 100 bucks a month in rent?","My husband and I are living in a relative's granny unit (300 sqft) because of the CA housing crisis. It is extremely difficult to find a place to accommodate us, our baby and our cat where we live. If we can afford a place (barely), they dont want cats. If they accept cats, they dont accept families. Also, my husband has a seasonal job (and I am not currently working due to our young baby), so even though he has unemployment funds and odd jobs for the next couple months, a landlord is likely not going to rent to us until he get rehired this spring (which IS a guarentee).

We initially moved into said granny unit because at 8 months pregnant, our landlord decided to end our lease the next month because she did not feel the apartment was big enough for us AND a baby (700 sqft, btw). 
So, out of the goodness of their hearts, our relatives offered their 300 sqft granny unit. They only ask that we pay 100 bucks a month to cover utilities we have been using. We give them 200, because we dont want to seem ungrateful- they really are helping us out. We could be homeless without them. 

We planned on finding a new place to live before my husband was laid off from his position in December. Alas, no such luck. We offered to pay his relatives much more in rent, because we would be staying longer than anticipated but they declined the offer. This part is important. 

Now, my husband and I have a bit of money in savings, and while the most financially responsible thing to do would be to stash it away, we are dying to get a little tent trailer to camp in. Being in 300 sqft with a baby and a cat is tough. It gets claustrophobic. We love to camp, and with the baby, a tent just seems too uncomfortable. We want to buy a used tent trailer for around 4 grand. 

When my husband told his parents the idea (they are also closely related to our relative), they said that it was a bad idea and our relatives would be upset that we were spending so much money when they were being generous letting us live at their place for next to nothing. His parents said that our relatives believe we should be saving our money while we can.

I completely understand the idea, but the reason we are in cheap housing is because of the lack of housing availability, not just the cost of rent. We have OFFERED to pay more in rent! Even market value!

We’ve been dating for around 4+ years now and have a child together (1yo.)

We’ve had some issues and are on a little bit of a rocky road atm because of me wanting to change careers. I work 12 hour rotating shifts at a polyester plant, and the shifts are long and usually wear me out by the time that I’m off. I don’t get free time at work because I have no relief for my area, so I have to scarf down any food and rush bathroom breaks.

Whether it be someone cut her off, or her mom did something, or something I general pissed her off (everything seems to piss her off.) In the entirety of my 40 minute drive while were on the phone, I may get around 5 minutes of talking into our conversations.

We've been together 10+ years.  I work a full time job with a regular schedule (40 hrs a week).  My wife makes it seem like I expect too much from her, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable. 

\- My typical schedule is leave for work at 7am and home by 6pm. 

\- My daughter is in school from 9-1 and is usually napping in the afternoon after having lunch.

My wife will clean our townhouse (3/3 approx 2,100sq ft if it matters) maybe once every three or four months and it's typically when she asks her mom to come over to help.  The mom ends up doing most of the cleaning. Wife might cook a meal for the family maybe twice or three times a month.  House is pretty messy in between.  Wife does dishes most of the time, but regularly lets it pile up until she really has no choice but to clean them.  Wife doesn't typically take my daughter to do extra activities beyond school (i.e. community park, play date, pool, museum, movie, etc.). I do my own laundry and prepare most of my meals. Wife does do daughter's laundry, but she will not do her own laundry for weeks with a perpetual pile of clothes in her closet.  My daughter goes to bed at 10pm (because she naps) which leaves me with little time to myself after I get home.  When I get home I spend most of my time doing something with my daughter or preparing and eating dinner.  We take turns bathing and putting our daughter to bed.  Wife recently started exercising and she regularly waits for me to come home and to do her routine and then bath which has really frustrated me because she has the school time or nap time to do those exercise.

Edit: Thanks for all your responses and taking the time to give me some advice.. I just got back to this post and didn't expect such a large response. I'll go through these comments and reply to questions. 

Here is some additional background and responses to some comments. She does take my daughter to a 45 minute ballet class once week.  I never expected wife to be a SAHM, but she is the one that has opted not to work. I encourage her to go back to work. I do think staying at home for so long has gotten to her. She claims to want to wait until 2021 when daughter is in kindergarten to get back to work. She may be suffering through depression. A counselor might be worth a try. I can't really have a serious discussion with her with her raising her voice.  There were several comments on my daughter's bed time. It is tiring having a daughter with a late bed time, but on the positive side I have spent a ton of time with her after work that most parents don't get. On the weekend, she wakes up at 9 or 10, so that's a plus too.  She is waking up at 7:30 so it's typically 9 hours of sleep with a 1-2 hour nap. I think she gets enough sleep.","1578198070.0","Not the A-hole","459","169"

My roommate and I have lived together for a couple of months. We moved into this apartment together and split everything 50/50 


My friends cat had a litter of kittens and asked me to take one for her. I asked her first if it was fine since we were planning on moving in together after College and she said yes. 

So the cat is generally not a problem and I keep the food/ litter box in my bedroom. 

Well, this is my roommates first time living without parents and she was super thrilled to decorate. 

I like it too of course, and our living room/ bathroom is all done up and we do not let the cat in unattended. My cat only has domain of my room and the hallway connecting all the rooms. 

After Christmas, my roommate got a lot figurines and some hanging string art thing as gifts. She immediately put them in the hallway where we walk in. 

I told her I was not comfortable with her keeping that stuff there because -I have a cat. Even if the cat hasn’t broken anything yet- there is always the chance she can. 

Plus- glass figurines would hurt the cat if they break 

We moved the figurines to the living room and she insisted on leaving the hanging thing- which was expensive 

I told her over and over I didn’t want it there, and she flipped out over how we would just see what the cat does and if she ruins it, I’d just have to replace it because I’m responsible for my cat. She got the thing for the hallway which we equally pay for and she should get an equal say in what goes in there 

Idk what’s the problem with moving it into the living room. I understand the hallways is this shared space and she didn’t have much experience with pets -but idk why she’s so insistent on this and I am not going to replace something I’ve warned about.


I suggested getting photos or something that’s not string dangling from the wall, but she won’t budge and is pissed with me for just not making the cat stay off of the furniture when we aren’t home. 

She told me to shut the cat in my room when we’re out and I refused- to cut her off of 50% of her living space is unfair after this many months 

I tried to explain that she’s a cat, she can’t be trained as easily as a dog. She won’t do it in front of us and never broke anything but you never know why happens when we’re out.

My mom has been in a relationship for the last 10 years and for the past 5 she and her partner spend at least one holiday with his family.
Each year, one of my younger brothers and I spend one holiday with her and the other one with our other relatives (he with his father and me with my great aunt since I was raised with her and she's like a mother to me)

This year, we were both supposed to be at home for new year (we picked that one since we would be at our house), it was important to me because I always loved this holidays and having actual quality time with my mom, also I moved out to another province in February for studying and haven't seen my family more than twice (just a weekend each time) since then. 

But last minute changes were made, we were going to my mom's in-laws (I don't like them since they've never been kind towards me, my brothers-one of them their grandkid-, or my mother), I was okay with it anyway, then asked if they'd have any vegetarian food for me (I know they put meat in almost any food), they say no. I said I would bring something for me and although they were petty about it they ended up agreeing.

Once we were there they started making passive agressive comments about my brothers (the middle one is autistic and sometimes can't help being ""annoying"", and the youngest just turned 4 so it's not easy to keep him quiet), my mom's job, and making fun of me for my food choices, my appearance, dropping out translation and getting into law school, while also saying things about how I don't have it hard with my great aunt's health since I'm not her biological daughter (she's been really sick and we all know she has not much time left)

The last thing was just enough. I got up and went outside to wait for my family to finish dinner and leave. I was almost crying since that subject is really delicate for me.

Once we were heading back home my mom's partner started saying how ungrateful, annoying and crybaby I was, and how his parents were mad at me for doing that, how they couldn't enjoy their dinner and celebrate such a beautiful day, how I was just a picky eater and wanted to annoy them, etc.

I just asked him to pull over near a friend's place and stayed there for the night to avoid confronting him after noticing my brother was on the verge of an attack.

"ejd24f","1578043114","AITA for avoiding my bf's mom?","Me and my boyfriend have been dating for nearly four years. My relationship with his mom started out relatively good. Our relationship has always remained surface level to avoid any arguments, and I have never attempted to have or participate in any political/moral arguments with her. My first problem happened with her a few months after my bf and I started dating. Basically she walked in on us having sex. She freaked out (understandably so). Anyways, that same day, she sat us both down and had a long talk with us. My issue with this talk was how demeaning she was towards me. She basically blamed me for the entire thing and my boyfriend wasn’t in trouble at all, and made me out to be some slutty teenager. She kept telling me it was my fault and that my actions were disrespectful to her and her home, but never so much as pointed a finger at my boyfriend. It was awful. I kept my distance for a bit but after a while the situation was forgotten and my relationship with her returned to normal. 

Fast forward to a little over a year ago, I was in my first year of college and was really encouraging my bf to go. He really wanted to go at the time, but did not understand the whole fafsa thing, or applying or anything. His parents never gave him any guidance or help with college whatsoever, so I ended up taking that role. We figured out he needed to have various tax and finance information from his mom, so I had him reach out to her to get the info. I thought this would be pretty easy considering he lives with her, but she was being extremely avoidant and kept putting off giving him the info. We ended up going over there together one night to try to explain the fafsa process and have her fill in the info. I intended to take a back seat in this, as I didn’t want to be confrontational, but then she started saying things that weren’t making sense and accusing my boyfriend of tons of stuff, so I stepped in and calmly explained what it was that he needed from her. She flipped out and starting screaming at my boyfriend, so I went to the basement to let them work it out. I then overheard her screaming that he needs to break up with me and that I’m rude and selfish. I stayed in the basement, and after about 10 minutes he came down to get me so he could take me home. The whole thing left both of us very upset (my boyfriend did not deserve the screaming and honestly his parents being so apathetic towards his future infuriates me but that’s another thing). Anyways, my boyfriend made amends and she ended up doing the fafsa, however, I have not really seen or spoken to her since. The past few months my boyfriend has expressed that he is upset that I never want to see his mom and that I hate her.

I'm a 14 y/o freshman and me, my friends, and cousins use a videogame marketplace/platform called Steam a lot to play videogames with each other. A day or two after Christmas, Steam had been holding a winter sale, and in great Christmas spirit my cousin (my age) let me choose a couple of games that added up to $20. I really appreciated this and promised him I would also give him games as a Christmas gift when time came. I don't have a credit card so I would have to wait for an opportunity to go to a store and buy a gift card for him.

Fast forward 2-3 days later, after another family Christmas party, I see my little sister opening presents from the 'white elephant' game we played. Right next to her was a $20 Steam gift card which caught my eye. I went up to her and asked who it was for, and she replied with silence. This led me to assume it was mine, because my little sister had never heard of Steam and at the Christmas party they had a habit of hiding multiple gifts in one. So I put the money in my Steam account, waited the next day (it was late), and in similar fashion gave my cousin a choice to select a couple of games that added up to $20 for me to buy for him. Not to mention, the winter sale introduced a new system: 100 credits for every $1 you put in your account. So not only did I get credits that you could use to buy cosmetic items for your profile, but my cousin was able to receive the games that I promised. It was a win-win situation.

Until, I heard my dad yelling over the fact that the card was missing. He went up to me and asked me about it, and I said I used it to give my cousin games. He started yelling at me that my mom was supposed to give it to him as a gift (which I apologized for and offered my own $20 for them to give to my cousin, but my dad couldn't have cared less). I told him that it was my mistake that I took the card, but that it didn't matter because he still got the games. My dad said that I 'stole the ability for him to do anything he wanted, whenever he wanted with the money' (which I still don't understand because if he asked me to postpone the transaction I gladly would've, and i gave my cousin the choice to select games for me to buy). It turned into this big argument which led to my dad taking all the money I have in my wallet, including the money I got for Christmas (which adds up to \~$220) to 'teach me a lesson'.

Right after the whole ordeal, I contacted my cousin and apologized to him for taking the gift card that my mom was supposed to give to him. But even HE believed I did nothing wrong, I shouldn't have been punished, and that it doesn't really matter that I took it.

This led to ANOTHER big argument with my dad that got nothing solved, and I got grounded for my computer for the length of which he claims ""the rest of 2020"".

"ejdpwo","1578047680","AITA for not letting my brother move in with me?","My situation: late 40s, married, three kids under 12 (one toddler). I work full-time and have a second job which takes up maybe 5-20 hours a month depending. 

My wife studies full time and works part time.



My brother’s situation: 50, single, no kids. Lived off jobseeker’s (not sure what the US equivalent is but essentially he didn’t want to work his entire life so claimed benefits instead, got a free council flat etc) until approx age 45 when he met his (now ex) girlfriend who got him a part time job at the pub she worked at. He’s worked around 20 hours a week since then. Never worked full time because he doesn’t want to. 

He currently lives in a cheap house share with his ex girlfriend, her new husband and her dad (odd situation, I could go into it more but trying to keep it brief). Now that his ex is newly married, I think it’s just occurred to him that he no longer has a chance to get back with her and now he wants to move out. Because who would want to live in that situation?


Here is where I come in (apparently). My wife and I rent a 5 bed house, which leaves us with a spare room which we use as a home office (for her studies/sometimes I work from home) which has a sofa bed in, plus boxes and other bits we’re storing.

**Important to add - one large reason he cannot move in is because it would be breaching our contract. “They wouldn’t know!” is the response from my family.**


According to my brother and my mum, he should move into this room because he “needs somewhere to live”. Our opinion is that there is no NEED, only WANT. He chose to live with his ex girlfriend (and her dad) for over two years after they broke up because he hoped they would get back together, despite her actually being engaged to somebody else (not the current husband). He’s a deluded misogynist but that’s a whole other post.


My point is, he chose to live in this situation that was never going to end well. Now he wants to move out but doesn’t have the money for a deposit/first month’s rent BECAUSE HE CHOOSES TO ONLY WORK PART TIME.



My family are making me feel like a terrible person for not letting him move in. They’re very much the “blood is thicker than water” family type. 


Even if this was a “need” situation and not “want”, I would be hesitant to help. We live in the same city and he never gets in touch, he’s not a likeable person (hates women, still rants about women that turned him down 20 years ago) etc.



This is my home and my family and I don’t think he’s entitled to move in.

We got together soon after splitting up with our exes and have been together for over a year. My ex-wife is paranoid (almost clinically) and convinced that I left her for my new partner. I did not.
My mother has been very hostile to my new partner, largely because of the nasty and spiteful things that my ex-wife told her, none of which are true. And despite me trying to explain that it was all lies, my mother wouldn’t listen and thus I didn’t speak to her for almost 9 months. 
Her birthday is December and for the sake of this and Christmas I thought I would visit her, talk to her and try to make a clean slate of it. I didn’t take my partner with me as I knew it was going to be an awkward situation. 
Things seemed to be going ok, there were a couple of snide comments about my choice in women but I let them slide. Later the conversation turned to my partner and my mother told me she had done an internet search and found things out about my partner; for example she had another child but had put it up for adoption (untrue), that her family were gypsies (untrue) and that she continued to believe everything my ex-wife told her. I explained again that this was all total rubbish, but she would rather believe the lies and her google search that was so poor it would make a 5 year old blush!
Trying to be non-confrontational I politely gave her the birthday and Xmas presents and left. I haven’t spoken to her since and frankly have no intention of speaking to her possibly until next Xmas when I may try to wipe the slate clean again.

My mother (F, 50), was put up for adopted at birth in a region and time when records were sealed and poorly kept. It was no secret she was adopted for at least the duration of my (M, late 20's) life. To my knowledge, she never sought out her birth mother, and she maintained a close, healthy, relationship with her adoptive parents to this day.

Recently, she was contact by a woman (""X"") claiming to be her birth mother - fast forward a few months, many emotions, fact checking via exchange of letters, etc, they confirm this is in-fact the case. They've now met (despite living in different states) twice, and are semi-actively communicating on social media, etc.

Whilst I am very happy for my mother, this has been largely irrelevant to my day to day life; I moved out many years ago and have my own family, life, etc. Fast forward to Xmas, where ""X"" contacted me with a Xmas card asking to meet me and my family when she travels through the area we live in later in 2020. (Their travel I'm told is for unrelated reasons; but ostensible reason for timing of request).

This forced me to think on the issue more personally than I had previously, and I realized that I actually don't have any desire to associate with ""X"". I'm happy for my mother, and bear no hostility to ""X"" nor anyone else, but a relationship with ""X"" is not something I want for myself or my family.

That said, I'm concerned if that's the call I make, regardless of how well intended or polite, I'll be the Asshole.

I'm finding it tough financially due to student loans and just entering a career. My BF is quite comfortable financially. I suppose I use my budgeting for a part of my reasoning behind what follows. 

When we have dinner together, I typically cook enough for a 4 person meal.  My partner will have a 2 x 3 times portion of what I have. If I cook more, basically he just eats more - he works quite a labour intensive job. If there are any leftovers, my BF will always grab them for his lunch the next day. He works far earlier than I do, and uses that as his reason to take the left overs rather than buying or making lunch in the morning. 

I started to get slightly frustrated that I always had to purchase more food for myself for lunches. So I have started to put a bit extra on my plate every evening with the intentions of saving a small portion for my lunch the next day - meaning sometimes there was not enough for my BF to have leftovers.

My BF caught on to what I was doing and said that I am being a really crappy person, since it is not his fault his body needs more fuel. 

While I do agree with him there, I also find it difficult when I'm already scraping the bottom of the barrel to get by financially, that I also have to fund his large appetite.

My housemate went home for Christmas on 16th December 2019. I'm the only other person living in the house, along with his cat. Housemate is 12 years older than me and I am a female in her mid 20s. I was going home for Christmas on the 18th. Thus, my housemate got me to feed the cat until I left, and then asked me to set up an automatic feeder for the cat to feed him between 18th-23rd December. Anyway, I fed the cat manually until the 18th, of course, with no problems. I then set up the feeder on the 18th before I left, following the instructions on the box. I had a lot of trouble getting the lid on but had no reason to believe that I had done it incorrectly or anything like that; the clock on it was ticking etc. I left the cat an additional bowl of biscuits for snacks in between meals. The feeder is a second hand one and in my opinion, very hard to use. The cat was only going to get 4 meals in 5 days (not really enough in the first place), because that's all the feeder had slots for.

Not that this really is an excuse at all, but I had a migraine and was suffering from all of the effects of a migraine too (puking etc). Anyway, I went home that evening in spite of the migraine and whatnot - ""home"" is 300 miles away. When I got back on 2nd January after working remotely from my boyfriend's flat between Christmas and New Year, **my housemate informed me that the feeder hadn't worked and the cat hadn't eaten for 5 days.** On the 23rd, a neighbour came round to refill the feeder and discovered this. Another neighbour had also texted my housemate on the 22nd to say the cat had been meowing incessantly for food for several days outside their house (got his number from the cat's collar). My housemate got back on the 28th.

I basically accidentally starved the cat. I know I fucked up, and I feel like a horrible person who belongs in jail. I honestly don't know what I did wrong with the feeder, but I suspect it may have been something to do with the lid. My housemate is really pissed off at me and is being really patronising about it.

But like, in my defence, why the hell would you leave your cat alone for 12 days with just a basic, shitty old feeder to feed them? Put him in a cattery or don't have a cat. I have three cats who live with my mother since my housemate would not allow additional cats, and they're my absolute life. Every time we're away for more than one night (one night we trust my sister), we put them in a luxury cattery because we don't want to rely on other people and risk them being hurt or underfed. For context, I have a good job and can afford to look after three cats properly with vet care and everything, and can afford to put them in good catteries when needed, so I'm not an irresponsible pet owner. I'm moving in with my boyfriend soon and the cats will live with us.

Am I the asshole?

"ejee29","1578052175","AITA for reminding my boyfriend of my past relationship during drinking games?","My boyfriend and I (both in our early 20s) have been together for a few months short of a year. Before him, I’ve only been with one other guy, who I dated for close to four years. I’m my boyfriend’s first girlfriend. 

My boyfriend loves to drink, and even though I never used to enjoy it, he has made me realize how fun it can be. However, every time we go out, someone brings out drinking games like «never have I ever». This is where the problem arises.

The games often includes sexual statements. My boyfriend doesn’t like to be reminded that I have a sexual history prior to him, and so whenever I take a sip to a sexual statement of an activity that he knows we haven’t done together, he becomes upset. 

The same thing happened at a party we went to not long ago. When the game started, I, at first, didn’t drink at the statements I thought would upset him. Prior to the start of the game, however, we had already had a bit to drink, and as the game went on I stopped being so careful. My boyfriend became visibly upset, and wouldn’t look at me nor talk to me for close to an hour after we had finished playing. This in return made me upset, as obviously I don’t enjoy seeing him like this.

My boyfriend is great, and except for this we really have no issues. We have talked about this, and he says he doesn’t really see it as a big deal, it just upsets him. It still keeps nagging me, though. I feel as if I can easily avoid the problem by not participating in the drinking games, but then I also feel as if I’m missing out. I feel like an asshole, so I want to hear what other people have to say.

My parents are traditional & amazing. After immigrating, they were arranged to be married in their 30s after they had established careers and life plans and then had us. We don't believe a lot of their views. 

My mom wants us to have a degree before we start dating. This has always been the case.

My sister and I dated in our teens, and have had serious relationships in college, as well. Sometimes we got caught in our teens and gotten reprimanded (grounded, phones taken away, etc.), but it has not been an issue in college because we both moved away. 

In my sister’s junior year of college (3-4 years ago), she told my mom she wanted to date a guy. She was already dating this guy for a year at this point and things were getting serious, so she wanted to introduce this idea to my mom. My mom said that she would like us to wait till we have our degrees to start dating. My sister did it anyway, they kept dating for a couple years, and when my sister wanted to introduce him to our parents after they graduated my mom basically said “we don’t want to meet this guy unless you’re going to marry him”. They ended up breaking up. My mom being against meeting him did play a part in their breakup and my sister was angry with her about it for awhile, but she has a new bf now that my mom has met and they are both fine. 

I’ve been dating a guy for a year who knows all of this and knows I can’t introduce him in a bf capacity to my parents until I’m graduated (April 2021). My mom knows him because we went to high school together. I’ve told her that we both have feelings for each other but will wait until I’m graduated to start dating. She asks about him sometimes, but always stresses that she wants us to focus on our studies before dating. 

We hang out a lot and my mom knows and doesn’t question it because I tell her straight up that I’m hanging out with him. Today, for the first time, I brought him to our house when they weren’t home (grandparents were home). We stayed in the living room, did not touch, just ate and watched a movie. 

After work, my grandma told her I had someone over and she asked if it was the guy I liked. She accused me of dating him and asked why he was here. I told her that I still hang out with him in a friendly capacity even though we’re not dating. She retracted and apologized for assuming and just mentioned the studies thing again. 

My fear is that after she meets him in a bf capacity, she finds out we were dating for approximately 2.5 years before I told her, she won’t trust him or me and it will damage mine & his relationship with her. 

I love my mom a lot. I don’t subscribe to her beliefs, but I do very well in school and hold up all her expectations of me. I felt really bad lying to her today and I keep shrugging it off as a future problem, but I feel guilty.

So for context: my SO and I were renting a place outside the city we work in,but the landlord upped the rent too far and travel was expensive and about 1.5 hours one way. Not the worst but tough.

My mom offered a cheap(er) room in a house she owns and it's only 20mins walk to work for each of us. 
Problem was our furniture, two computer desks and a TV, she said that one roommate was moving out and she wanted that to be aliving room so to put our furniture there. We offered to pay extra rent but my mom refused.
Tenants of the house were a lady  moving out, my sister (also cheap rent) and her GF.

We helped lady move and moved our furniture in. The house has two living rooms now, my sis and her GF use the first one with the sofa.
We set up our things and they got angry with us for not talking to them first. Which was wrong but I rarely see them and just wanted to use my computer. I apologized and offered to move anything and if it was an issue look into storage of our desks. 

They said it was fine they just want an apology and access to the room, I said of course.

Things are tense, they use the living room with the sofa, we use the one with our TV and desk chairs. 
They're less than friendly with us (my sis and I were never close) they stop talking when we enter a room and start again after we leave, we say hello they grunt etc. I'm not trying to be their best friend, just trying to act normal.
So it goes for 3 months. 
My mom calls says she has a sofa, I say great when do you want us to look at it, she says no she has one at the front door and needs help bringing it in (my mom is like this). 
We put it in front of the TV and all is good, until the others get home and confront us for not telling them about the sofa, we explaine that was our moms choice but they didn't seem convinced. We go for a 3 week trip and when we come back they have a large sofa in the living room we use and my mom said that sis bought a house. I think cool they'll be out soon, just have to play nice and squeeze around the sofa.

SO and I have 3 days off for new year so we have a gaming marathon, quietly, the volume was low enough that they weren't aware we were in the room. They sit in with us and read, for hours for 2 days. 

Day 3 they explode at us.

How we need to open windows because of our BO,how we're disgusting people for forcing an old lady out and pawing through her things (said lady seemed very grateful for the help). How we don't wash our recyclables property forcing them to go through our trash and clean it (we rinse everything but don't always use soap)

Now they're talking about waiting until 2022. I know this won't solve the issue with their parents. It may calm things down for a while, but when the date approaches, they will push back again. Despite this, the parents want a big wedding bash so they can invite all their rando friends (even though they don't want to pay for it). The couple refuse to elope.

For the past year-and-a-half, I've been there to offer her advice and support for every bump in the road. My engagement is going smoothly and I've set a date, which I'm sure makes her jealous. People have started to question if she's even engaged, as no firm plans have been made. She now messages me about it daily, usually in the midst of an emotional breakdown.

I've given her all the best advice I can: she's never going to make her parents happy, so she should do what makes her and her fiancé happy. They can't count on their parents' money, so they should host an event they can afford. She likes my suggestions but never commits to any. No matter what I suggest, she seems paralyzed and just says stuff like ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I'll never be happy,"" ""I'm too scared to stand up to them."" She and her fiancé have discussed countless compromises, but they always end up back at square one. Currently, they say they will sign for a venue in a couple months, but I know that before then, one or both sets of parents will intervene, and she will cave.

I've decided I'm sick of having these conversations every day when she clearly refuses to listen. I'm tired of talking in circles. I'm tired of trying to help her stand up for herself when she cannot. I want her to be happy, but I don't want this to go on indefinitely. So WIBTA if, when she next brings up her ""wedding,"" I gently tell her that I don't want to talk about it anymore? And should I also refrain from discussing the details of my own wedding so it doesn't hurt her feelings?

TLDR: Best friend has been trying to plan her wedding for almost 2 years, but parents keep yelling and bullying her into canceling any plans. She ignores all my advice and just keeps feeling sorry for herself. I've done all I can for her, now I want her to stop talking about it until she makes up her mind.

ETA: She's already in therapy, and has been for over 15 years. It's not the magic cure-all that people seem to think it is.","1578083508.0","Not the A-hole","140","55"
"ejf7f7","1578057000","AITA for taking my mother on holiday?","So a bit of backstory to this is needed, my mother last year married an asshole (I am well past my mid 20’s and my brother is 22 so we don’t really care to much or call him our step dad) 

Her husband has an adopted daughter. 

Now last year for my birthday I purchased and paid for myself and my husband to go on holiday, as the flights were so cheap I said to my mother ‘look there are cheep flights, we will probably get a large villa anyway so you’re more than welcome to join us’ she and her husband then paid for my brothers, my step sister and her 3 kids plane tickets to come with us - we paid for 100% of the accommodation costs.

The holiday was a disaster, her husband was nasty to my husband and my brother who has autism, this has then led to me and my husband not speaking to him since coming home - therefore straining mine and my mothers relationship.

Now here is where the AITA comes in, so my mother and her husband had saved up to do a long weekend in Prague late last year, however my mothers husband decided it wasn’t fair that I got a holiday for my birthday and his daughter didn’t so decided to use this money to take himself and his daughter to Amsterdam for her birthday instead! Leaving my Mum pretty upset.

I for Christmas decided to book us both a holiday to Prague since she really wanted to do and we need some mother daughter time since this issue us put a big strain on our relationship.

She has got annoyed since she thinks I only did it to be petty, her husband is angry and it’s all blown up in my face a bit.

So AITA for buying my mother a holiday when I kind of deep down knew it would make him annoyed?

She didn't ask, just told us and asked what dates we could go dress shopping next month (through a text). I had seen her the day before and she told me that I have to wear a dress to her wedding and that I better wrap my head around the idea. I made it clear that I would not be wearing a dress. Her soon-to-be husband was on my side and said that he didn't care what I wore.

I should probably add a little more info about me: I'm a lesbian and wear men's clothing in my everyday life. I plan on never wearing a dress the rest of my life. It's not who I am and everyone knows that. However, an important thing to note and I feel like an asshole about this but I wore a dress in our other sister's wedding. It was four years ago and I'm a much different person now.

Anyways, I sent her an email the next day with some pictures of alternatives I could wear to help her see that there are other options out there. She said her answer was still no. A couple days later she emails me again asking about my availability for dress shopping. 

So I responded by saying I was sorry but can't wear a dress even though it seems unfair that I wore a dress in our other sister's wedding but I'm a different person now. I've come a long way in accepting myself for who I am and can't go back. I need to be true to myself. I mentioned how this will effect my mental health (I have multiple diagnosed mental illnesses that she is aware of and I'm in therapy). I also gave her some more ideas on how to make this work.

She replied with ""This is just unacceptable to me, my wedding it the most important day of my life thus far and there is no way I can have 5 guys in tuxedos, myself in a white dress, \[other sister\] in a pink dress and then you in... pants? It's absolutely absurd that you can't wear a dress for 4 hours, when just a few years ago, you wore one for \[other sister\] without question. \[other sister\] has beautiful photos to look back on, where she is the center of attention and we are all there in the color she chose, the dress she chose, the shoes she chose, with our hair and makeup done, because that's what you do when your sister gets married. I cannot understand where your coming from because life is full of doing things that you don't necessarily want to do, or doing things that are out of a person's comfort zone, but you just do them. You especially do them for family. I'm willing to work with you on a dress you feel most comfortable in, I'm not asking you to wear something ridiculous. You've worn how many dresses in your lifetime? You not wearing a dress takes away from my day, where I should get to make all of the decisions and have all of the attention.

My girlfriend is meeting up with an old friend (let’s call this friend B) that she met in college, were both still in college too. My gf came out as bisexual a year ago and we have been in a monogamous lesbian relationship since then.

Before my gf was “out” she would make out with her girl friends at parties for fun (when she actually had feelings for them despite not truly knowing). Friend visiting is one of these girls. 

Last time my gf visited her with another friend (friend A), friend B asked if she could still kiss my girlfriend now that she’s in a relationship, which my gf responded to with a “no.” 

Friend B is staying with friend A this week so they are all hanging out this week. They’ll be drinking so my gf will be staying with them as well. Last night my gf made a comment while we were all hanging out that her “and friend B will just sleep on the couch together!” which caught me off guard. To be fair though the apartment only has a bed and the couch, and friend A will likely be sharing the bed with her boyfriend already. Am I being toxic/just overly insecure? Can I bring this up or is there another proposal I can offer?

I’m mostly just uncomfortable because friend B seems pushy, still was confused why she couldn’t kiss my gf after she said no. I would say also that I find sleeping together very sensual and valuable(?) to me, so I would feel “off” if they slept together. Both of us have talked about how we would never cheat on each other and I trust my gf but I’m not sure about the friend. 

I would like to note we both talk about our boundaries and are usually perceptive and respectful of them, and it seems we just never came across this one before! Like overall we’re both really happy in the relationship so I want to keep it that way :)

Basically she can really talk about herself, but she’s my friend and I want her to have someone to speak to. 

She’s also renowned for being very over sensitive. She makes fun of people but can’t handle it when it happens back to her. But I always listen to her, speak, and give my 2 cents because I know she just thinks a lot. 

She messaged me last night about a problem involving me and my partner. I’ve told her multiple times how I will help fix this problem, and I have insisted that I’ve heard her, understood her, and get what she’s saying completely. She’s said thank you. 

She just keeps repeating the same things. I do love her, but there’s nothing more I can say now except for responses to what she’s repeating and telling her I hear her and that I will get on fixing it, but that there’s not much more I can do, which she admitted herself.

She told me she could either give me 15€ back or I could get another piece of clothing for 15€ which would've been way better for them...I tried looking, but the only thing that cost 15€ was the exact same shirt I had already bought in another color, and one I didn't particularly like.

I apologized and asked if it was possible to just get my money back, I know 15€ aren't much and they aren't going to change my life, but I'm not exactly rich and 15€ means food for 2-3 days.

On top of getting up early the last couple of days I’ve been working overtime most days into early hours of the morning and not getting a whole lot of sleep due to conflicting work schedules with my room mates so I was running on very little sleep.

After finding my seat on the plane I see a family of 5 get on the plane (Mum, Dad and three boys under the age of 10 ) and pray that they won’t be sitting near me but they were.

I had specifically booked a window seat so I could rest against the window and sleep and for some reason the parents had booked the two aisle seats and the complete middle row so the kids could sit in middle and they would sit either side, but the rows weren’t lined up exactly so the mum and dad were slightly in front of the children and had to look back. 

I could hear the parents arguing and and knew it was coming the Mum turns to me and ask me if I’d mind moving to one of the aisle seats so it would be easier for them to sit together with one parent in the aisle and one kid next to the parents in my seat.

I said I’d rather not because I was really tired and had specifically booked a window seat the mother explained and tried to ask again and I said if there were no other options I’d move they asked some other people to move but nobody else wanted move either.

I bought my home in Oct with the plan to get floors installed and move in Dec. Roomie was okay with this, insisting she couldn't live with carpet. I gave her a good deal on rent as they're starting their own practice & a friend. Market rate is 4-500$/room I offered $350. Only condition is her dog must get along with my pets. She assured me the dog is super friendly.

Shortly after she lets me know her parents are selling the house she's living in. She needs to move her stuff out of their house. Okay fine, she moves several items into the garage.

Then a week later another set of panic texts that her parents have a buyer. her & the dog must go, can she move in early? I say ok but there are no floors, house is a work in progress, I'm pulling out carpets and laying new flooor myself, & my work has me working 60 hour weeks so timeline for floors is delayed. I say instead of $350 she can pay $250 a month until floors are put in.

This is when I noticed anytime my dog comes over her dog will attack him if anyone pays attention to my dog over her dog. UGH & she's broke so a trainer isn't an option. Fine, I volunteer in dog rescue & have friends who can do it as a favor.

Final straw is in the last month she's told me she can't afford rent this month (apparently her dad was going to lend her money but didn't) so we barter and I get free care in lieu of rent. Not ideal, but ok.

Now she's complaining that there are boxes everywhere, & the house is chaotic, & it's affecting her mental health. She is not paying or helping with the flooring or moving (she literally complained about empty boxes near the recycling bin. Is it unreasonable to think I'd they're bothering you move them to the recycle bin outside?) but is hassling me for a timeline or gameplan, telling me over & over again how stressful this is for her.

I get it's stressful to live in a construction zone, but it's also a warm, safe house in a nice neighborhood. she's lived there from November through now only paying $293.

I thought it was clear that she would be moving in to a working project & things would be chaotic for a while. I've continuously tried to accommodate her but it's never enough.

I wasn't expecting her to be like taken away from work or face repercussions or (hopefully not) be fired. So she started blowing up my phone and saying I possibly cost her a good job.

Moved into a new apartment building on Tuesday and last night was my third night there. There are 4 apartments upstairs, picture a square divided into quarters. The first two nights I didn't hear any dogs barking at all, but around 6:30pm last night I started hearing a dog barking and whining while I was making dinner. It continued non-stop for a few hours, until finally around 9:30pm I ran out of patience and texted the landlord saying that a dog had been barking for the past few hours, I couldn't sleep, and to please reach out to the other tenants and let them know. She got back to me saying that only one upstairs tenant (directly next to me) has a dog and she said she ""couldn't hear any barking."" I listened closer, it sounded crystal clear behind the head of my bed, but started to sound like it was coming from below me. I let the landlord know that it may be below me, and she said that the apartment below me was vacant. I went outside and peaked in the window of the vacant apartment below me and saw that the bathroom light was on and the door was cracked open. I told the landlord this, in fear that someone broke in and possibly abandoned a puppy, and she told me to call the police and have them check it out. Police show up and I looked like a total asshole because by the time they got there around 10:30pm the barking had stopped. Lo and behold, tenant ""B"" (neighbor) had gotten home and it was their dog all along, they had lied to the landlord and said they didn't hear any dogs even though they weren't home at the time. After the cops left I could hear my neighbor and someone else through the wall yelling about how I'm a piece of shit to call the cops on my first night there (it was my 3rd), ""we weren't even gone for 3 hours that's bullshit,"" how it's inconsiderate because ""I [she] have to live here."" I feel like it's inconsiderate to me because I too have to live there and wanted to go to sleep early after a long day of unpacking. My neighbors hate me now and I haven't even met them yet.

"ejggdx","1578063422","AITA for not disclosing my single mastectomy before a date","Two years ago I had breast cancer and had to have a single mastectomy. I was lucky. It was stage 1 and the surgery was easy. It changed so much in my life though. I became reserved and cautious. I was told it would likely come back. To prepare for that and do the follow ups religiously. 

I entered the dating world reluctantly about 3 months ago. Mostly just to meet new people. Friends. I was very clear about just wanting to make friends and keep it casual. I am very reluctant to open up about my medical history. 

I also started a new job around that time. 
I opted not to do reconstruction with a fake single breast because of a lot of reasons. I wear a prosthetic at work. 

A coworker recently fixed me up with a friend of his. We talked for a few weeks before I agreed to a date. We had a lot in common but the conversations never got real deep. I wanted to meet him before I disclosed my medical history. We agreed to a casual friendly coffee. 

We hit it off during that meeting and he asked me to dinner. We went to dinner. A real date. It was fantastic.  At his car he leaned over to kiss me and tried to touch my breast either on purpose or accident.  I pushed his hand away and told him about my surgery and cancer. 

He seemed nice about it but said he had to go. 

Later he ghosted me which is fine but he told his friend, my coworker, who also didn’t know, that it was a lot like surprising someone with the fact you are dying or transgender or married or have 9 kids. He heavily implied I wasted his time and mine and he felt led on in a text he sent me a few days ago to “close it all out” (his words). I never responded. I don’t know how to. 

My coworker is saying I should have told him straight away. It just didn’t feel like the right time. It is a really private thing. 

I do feel bad he felt his time was wasted on me though.

"ejggtd","1578063473","AITA For Cutting Her Out?","I've known Jenny since high school and we stayed close through the years. We started growing distant after she started dating her now husband and they moved in together. I moved back to my hometown after school and she would always want to hang out, but never wanted to actually meet halfway and I drove a POS.  

We turned from friends to acquaintances after my parents passed away. I was depressed and couch surfing and she wanted me to drive 3 hours for a game night. I told her I couldn't come, she went through my FB friends list, found the person I was staying with and messaged her, NEVER MEETING HER BEFORE, saying she wants her to bring me to this game night and that shes more than welcome to come with me. My friend told Jenny if I wasnt feeling up to it, she wasnt going to make me go. 

Fast forward to December 2017. Jenny gets engaged. Shes excited, we talk wedding details. She wants me to be a braidsmaid but theres a catch. She wants me to write an ESSAY as to why I should be a bridesmaid. Then she changes her mind and says she wants me to be a ""bridal assistant"" since '[you] never hanged out with any of the groomsmen before and it would be too awkward.' She goes on to change her mind about that, insinuating she'd be embarrassed to have me in her wedding pictures and says 'dont worry you're still invited to the wedding though!' 
 
Fast forward to pre Bridal shower. I get the wedding invite, marked as 1 seat for the wedding. When I ask about it, she say unless I've been dating someone for 4+ years I can't bring a date. I wouldnt know anyone at this wedding and shes being a jerk about a +1. (It wasnt a cost issue). If it weren't for the fact I'd have to pay for shipping I would have returned the gift. But I had no use for it and I wasnt about to pay 30$ in shipping fees so I bit the bullet and went to shower. 

The shower was fine. At the end of the shower I told her I wouldn't be able to attend the wedding because I was going to be out of town and unfortunately I couldn't change my plans. She seemed upset but said she understood. 

A few days later she posted pictures from the shower and she did one of two things, she either omitted the photos I was in or cropped me out. (I could see my dress hemline in several group photos). I told myself she was just being petty. ( I never even got a thank you card for her bridal shower gift. ) 

The day I cut her out she basically attacked me (verbally) because I wasnt going to her wedding. I told her I made plans without realizing the dates and that not everyone can go to your wedding. She said she was hurt by my actions and I lashed out saying over the past 2.5 years shes hurt me, between not being considerate to the fact that I was depressed after my parents died, to making me jump through hoops to *maybe* get a chance to be in her wedding party to dictating if I could or couldn't bring a date to her wedding. Then before she had a chance to respond I blocked her on everything.

Because my ex moved out of the state, she is responsible for my son's travel costs. 

Very long story short, I was told my son would not be able to see me on Christmas even after I caved and offered to pay for the flight.

I just got defeated at this point and accepted that I wouldn't have my son for Christmas. I did document everything for our next court date.

On actual Christmas day, I get a call from a random number who turns out to be my son who's been waiting at the airport for two hours

Turns out, my ex put him on a plane and forwarded me the details from an email address I've never seen. It went straight to my spam folder. I rushed to pick him up and he's in a bad mood because of waiting so long. I apologized and tried to cheer him up.

The problem was that we were hosting a large dinner with a lot of our family. I had already shipped all the presents I got my son to my ex's house. Included in the packages were gift cards that my parents for him. So unfortunately, we had no actual gifts for him here.

I explained this to my son and I also wrapped up some things I got from the airport so he'd have something to open.

My family was shocked but happy to see my son.

When we get to the gift exchange it all went to shit. The lack of gifts for my son was very apparent and it upset him greatly. And he found out very quickly that I'd given him some gifts that were meant for me, which was pretty stupid on my part.

It all snowballed into my my son calling my mother a bad grandmother for playing favorites, causing her to cry. This created a huge argument between me and my brother and everyone went home really unhappy.

Over the next few days, several family members dropped by with some gifts for my son but he was completely not into it and barely talked to anyone all the way up to his return flight. He left most of his gifts behind.

I was diagnosed with depression and its largest effect is on my energy levels.  My weight isn’t doing me any favors either.  My wife (27F) isn’t incredibly active, but can’t go an entire day without making plans to do something, which is fine.  I like doing things with my wife and I can deal deal with her plans most of the time, but sometimes I get home from work and just need to sit in my lazyboy and watch a Netflix. 

For example, It’s common to go from having an entire weekend with no plans to her sister and 5 year old to come visit for a whole day. Then the next day we are going to her grandparents. The whole weekend gone in two sentences. I know it might seem normal but it just goes on and on and on. I can’t remember the last time i had a no-obligation, get stuff done (or not) kind of day.  

There are two more layers to this. 

1.  She NEVER asks me about any of the plans. She is happy to commit my time and then tell me the night before.  If I ever want to make my own plans I have to do so around her plans. Plus I always talk to her about it before making them.

2.  I don’t know if she does it on purpose or not, but she makes me feel bad telling her I don’t want to do what she has planned. Sometimes i think it is on purpose because she is always saying “you never want to do anything”. I could do 8 or 9 of 10 things she wants and still be told this.  It just seems manipulative and inconsiderate. 

This has led to me becoming bitter at times.  We have small arguments about it from time-to-time, she keeps making plans, and I keep piling on stress. It’s gotten to the point that I contest her plans every time.

However, today she laid out “our” weekend plans and i said “Nope, I’m staying home. You can do that on your own for once.” She comes back with “We haven’t seen them in forever.” I said “Well I could go a little longer.” She stormed off and I left for work. 

From her perspective I’m sure it’s annoying to have to force me out the door.  I could see her thinking that I’m just being lazy.

Since then we have moved to 3 houses, had 2 children, I finished grad school, and I started my career as a family nurse practitioner. We bought a house that we absolutely love 1.5 years ago and I have been in my dream job as a primary care provider for a year. My husband has been working for a large company since we moved here and things had finally started to settle down and we had a routine, which I so desperately needed after years of chaos. 

A few months ago my husband, worried about upcoming reorgs in his company, grew concerned for the safety of his position. Not wanting to be unemployed again, he started applying for jobs in different states. This made me nervous because I love our home and my job. He did not get the positions he applied for and after a few weeks, an announcement came out that his current job was safe. I was so relieved!

A week after I thought things were back to normal, my husband announced that he wanted to apply for one more promotion states away. I told him I didn't want to hold him back in his career, but if he got the position, I would not be happy or excited to move. Well, he got the position and that same day I found out I was pregnant with baby #3.

I struggled with postpartum anxiety and depression and having a routine and job that I loved really helped me. I am terrified to have to get licensed in another state (that is not very NP friendly), apply for positions in a saturated market, and start over as the new person in the practice again - all while pregnant/postpartum (depending). I do not want to take a break from my career because I love what I do and am learning so much. I also worry if I take time off I may forget things and have a large gap in my resume. I love my kids dearly, but being a stay-at-home mom is not for me. I explained all of this to my husband and he said ""I am the provider for our family. This is a huge promotion. This is what's best for our family. We are going."" (I only work part time and he is full time).

He did receive a significant promotion and we will be moving to a warmer state. We don't love the current city we live in and never wanted to be here long term, but I guess I just needed a few more years of stability before we uprooted ourselves again. I also thought when we were ready to move, we would make such a big decision together. My husband and his entire family are excited for this new adventure, but I'm just numb.

While we were at a bar chatting, one of her coworkers brought up in conversation one of their mutual acquaintances (who was not present) and started low-key making fun of them, in a harmless way at first. My friend tagged along.
They started talking about how 'strange' this person was, had a lot of tics and a speech impediment, seemed slow, behaved awkwardly around people and had an overall weird appearance, but they could not point out what exactly was off about them.
So my friend pointed out that I am a doctor, and maybe I could have a better understanding of what was going on with this person.
Her coworker got suddenly really excited, and started scrolling through her phone to show me a picture of this person so I could 'diagnose' them with some kind of syndrome. I thought that making hypotheses about a person's life through a picture without their consent or knowledge and just for the laughs was completely wrong, I got really uncomfortable, tried to quietly tell my friend that this was inappropriate but she didn't get it at first.

Instead of being happy for us, my wife’s mother would tell my step daughter that I’ll never be family, her and her mom are the only family she needs.  Even goes as far as telling the child my mother and father would never be grandma or grandpa, don’t even think about calling them grandma or grandpa.  Pure lunacy.

She tells me that her mom has decided our daughter belongs in that bum fuck town in the middle of no where, that’s where her family is.  I feel like I’ve been betrayed at that point.  Why wouldn’t you fight to keep our daughter with us?  Well, too late now.  Kid finishes school for the summer and, sure enough, she moves in with her grandma.

This caused so many problems between me and my wife.  It caused my wife to abandon our life where it was and take a transfer to be closer to her daughter.  So what did I do?  I also took a transfer, almost lost my job because of it.  Completely turned my world upside down.  Just seemed like all that time, effort, and money I put forth was all for nothing.

I also have reason to believe I'd be in the *exact* apartment he was applying for as well. 

The story isn't really complicated. Two of my friends (A and B) were looking to move into a nice apartment complex as roommates. One of other friends already lives at that complex and was taking advantage of the referral system. A knew I was looking for an apartment in the area as well and has been talking up living in the same complex for months. He was really excited about the possibility of this happening. 

Well, I toured the place yesterday and it is on my short-list of possibilities so far. Top 2. I shouldn't have issues with the application based on the conversation I had with the leasing manager. 

The issue arised yesterday when A told me that their application was denied and they couldn't live at the complex. Furthermore, A had mentioned earlier that day that he was ""moving in in about 11 days"" before he got the bad news. The apartment I toured is available on the 13th. 

So, WIBTA if I chose to live in the complex? Again, I have other similar choices. I am still touring other complexes. Should I just toss out that complex as a contender?

Unlike them, I(16M) was always so good at using technology and machines since I was a little kid as I'm a programmer and tech-savvy. My uncles and a lot of people always call me to help them fix their problems when it comes to that. No bragging.

So, today, my father(56M) was so excited today to tell me that he finally learned how to add languages alone with no help of anybody and asked me how is he doing.

I facepalmed, and asked him ""Uh, don't you use the computer since like...11+ year? How this is the first time you learned to do this very simple thing even when I taught you how to do that many times before?"" Some simple arguing happened, and he told me back ""You're just salty that we finally learn how to do stuff ourselves without you. You just like us to be dependant on you"" and he left the room so disappointed and upset.

I think what I said is totally justified. I didn't try to sugarcoat it or anything, we literally have the computer for a very long time ago. How the heck he just started learning this very simple thing just now? He asked me and I answered. But I dunno, maybe it's because I'm autistic so I came for a third opinion.

For a little background, I do freelance work in graphic design and my full time job is totally unrelated.

So a couple of weeks ago, a friend from high school asked me if I could do him a favor. He wanted me to create a logo and some product label designs for his girlfriend’s (whom I’ve never met before) business for free. I said sure, since their pegs were really simple to do and well, because it was almost Christmas. I was feeling a bit generous. However my schedule was kinda tight and couldn’t prioritize their project just yet, and I made sure he knew that. He said he was fine with it and I could just take my time, no worries. Cool right?

But then a week later, I was out with a coworker after our shift. We hung out at a nearby cafe, which I should mention is super tiny and borderline cramped. Like the establishment could only fit like 20 or less people max. In comes my friend with his SO.

I made eye contact with him several times and attempted to say hi from afar, but he would only look away and pretend he never saw me. I felt really dumb and got too ashamed to approach his table to greet them. What made it more awkward was the fact that our tables were just about 3 meters apart, so it’s nearly impossible for him not to notice me.

I don’t want to do their project anymore. I mean, the least he could do was just acknowledge the person rendering him free service. But idk, perhaps I may be too entitled? So reddit, WIBTA if I ditched their project?","False","No A-holes here","5","21"

This dog was matted pretty bad and was very skinny, nor had a collar. Hes an amazing dog and I love him. We initially put out a lost dog post on my mom's facebook and called our animal pound to see if anyone lost him but then removed it because we were going to keep him, no luck. We then found a post on a facebook group saying they lost their ""grandma's service companion dog"", her exact words not service animal, around where I live, but still a mile away from us. It's almost a no brainer this dog in this post is the dog we have. We found him on the 20th of December and on the 22nd they finally posted they lost the dog saying they lost him on the 19th, meaning he couldn't have been matted and starving while he was lost. The amount of matting and ""malnutrition"" couldn't happen in one day from being lost. (i hope this makes sense, I'm saying that the owners didn't feed him right and didn't groom him regularly) it's been around two weeks and they haven't posted anymore about him and we haven't seen posters for him (if I lost my dog, I'd be constantly looking for her and have posters everywhere) He seems to enjoy our house an loves our other dog.

I usually park in front of this particular house cause it’s closest and usually has spots open. I could technically park further away but it just doesn’t make sense to do that when there’s perfectly good parking right there.

On New Year's Eve my friends and I (18F) had a dinner party planned, because we really wanted to adult. I thought that we would just be at my friend's house all night, but instead when I got there (I was running late because I was working) I was told that they had decided to go out to one of their friends after dinner. A guy named Eli (18/19M) who I had never met before. I wasn't complaining, it was fine. Long story short we went to his house, then out to what we thought was a party but turned out to be a bust, then back to his house.

 I was drinking pretty much constantly the entire time, so I was not really in my right mind by the time we got back to his house, but it was the same for most of us, including Eli. Anyway, him and I ended up hooking up back at his house at around 4am, before I went back to my friend's house to sleep. I, being an idiot, forgot my backpack, which has my wallet and phone charger in it. I go back to university very soon and it's out of province. On New Year's day he texted me saying to come pick it up, but I really didn't want to see him. I don't even really remember hooking up with him, and I don't think we talked before that.

Anyway, we typically have to leave at around 5:30am to get to the resort in time for opening. I live 3 minutes away from the freeway that we take to get there, but about 20 minutes from my friend. Usually go to my friend's place, park, go to the resort, and then come back at 6 or 7 pm.

This is all fine and dandy, but this week, my family is visiting from out of town. They need my car at home to use, so I asked to be picked up instead.

He asked if I could be dropped off, I said no because I didn't want to burden my family at 5 in the morning to drop me off.

Details relevant to the context at hand: had a falling out with my dad. Not the first, but certainly my last, as far as I'm concerned. I've pretty much cut him out of my life. He's the type of father that believe his kids are his property, and that he holds supreme authority over them for life. He basically demanded that I follow in his footsteps of being a physical worker. I became an IT sysadmin. He doesn't like that, except when he messes his computer up.

My sister has had similar issues with him, but is much more lenient and forgiving towards him. Even forgave him for lashing out at her because she took exception to him minimizing the loss of her unborn. I still can't fathom how she let that one go; she's stronger than I am in that sense, I'd say.

Now, my sister will get married. Of course, I got invited, and so did my dad. I know my dad has this tendancy of being confrontational, and I suspect he may use that opportunity to get back at me. I certainly hope to be wrong on that account. Now I definitely don't want to ruin her day, I'd feel guilty about it until the end of time. BUT, I also told her that if he tries anything that's out of line with me, I won't take it laying down.

"eji0rt","1578070103","AITA for not inviting my friend to my NYE party?","
I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting.
So for context, my best friend and I moved out together to go to college. I’m 20 and she’s 19. When we lived at home, we were 5 minutes apart from each other, and we’ve been pretty inseparable for about 3-4 years. 
It’s also important to know that her home life isn’t the best and she struggles with abandonment issues.

because of this,  usually she was over at my house and hanging out with my family. We welcomed her and she often spent the night and we treated her like one of us. 
when we moved to college, we were in a 6 person dorm, and roomed separately. I quickly became friends with our other roommates, but for her it just took a little longer. she got jealous whenever I went out with them and she wasn’t there with us. (the only times I didn’t invite her were when she wasn’t home or at work.) My older brother and a few cousins live in the same college town, so I get together with them often. She’d get upset and send me passive aggressive texts and comments if she wasn’t invited, saying I was abandoning her. I invited her to most of those hangouts, but some things are for family.

Anyways, its the day before NYE.  She drove back home for the holidays, as we only live 30 min away. Our college is having one of the biggest NYE parties in the state, and I thought it’d be super fun to go with her. I texted and asked if she wanted to go, what time the party started, ticket prices, etc. She said she was feeling sick but she’d let me know. 

Now it’s NYE, 5 pm. Still nothing from her, despite a follow up text an hour earlier. I text my parents and ask what their NYE plans are. They’re having over some family friends we’ve known for a long time, my brother will be home, and they’re going to play games, eat good food, and watch the football game that’s going on. I decide i’m going to join them. While i’m getting ready, I see one of my roommates as the last person home, and I ask her what her plans are. She moved from several states away, and had no plans other than to drink sparkling cider alone in the apartment. I invite her with me, because who would want to be alone on NYE? 

We go to my house, and we have a good time and the whole night is full of laughter. at around 10 my friend finally texts me that she’s feeling too sick to go to the party. Mind you I’d let her know earlier the party started at 8. At midnight, we all celebrate with streamers and sparkling cider, the whole thing. my roommate posts a short clip on Snapchat, and we drive home.
The next morning, I get a text from my friend. it reads:

“hey, i just saw [roommate’s] snapchat story & i’m just gonna ask so i don’t just let it keep bothering me lol. is there a reason she was invited to your house & i wasn’t?”

In her 10-11 months of trying to have a baby, she's had two incidents of essentially false positives. In month 5, she had a positive test, followed by a negative test and her period in the evening. She called that a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage. Three months after that, she had the same thing happen, but the negative test and period were the next morning. She has been sad over this and views it as losing two children.

Her doctor has decided to believe her, and has agreed to give her repeat pregnancy loss testing, as the standard is now two losses, and her husband is also being tested. 
**Here's the thing: there is a 95-99% chance this woman has NEVER been pregnant.**

Chemical pregnancies are pregnancies, but the tests are just too close together to have been a correct positive result. She has of course been beside herself about ""being infertile"" and ""never being able to have children"". They've been trying for under a year still. It's entirely possible that her husband is sterile to begin with. 

The medical misinformation is really getting on my nerves and I'm tired of hearing hysterics from everyone in my community about a woman who likely DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I've told her that she's very likely never been pregnant, and apparently that makes me an asshole and insensitive to her ""struggle"". I don't doubt that she's sad, or suffering, but this is a result of poor education and poor medical care.

Edit: 

I've called her and apologized. I still have my doubts about her ever having been pregnant beyond a heavy desire to be, but I am letting it go. I let my anger at the general misinformation about sex and reproduction taint my friendship with her. I'm just going to accept it at face value unless I'm specifically asked for my opinion.","1578110362.0","Asshole","6210","1414"

TL;DR: My ex-friend is dating a racist who has it out for me because he thinks I want to steal his girlfriend. His entire personality is just him trying to intimidate people and pretending to be hood, including the way he talks. He tells her what to wear because he thinks guys won't hit on her. She won't listen to me about him and thinks I just want her to be unhappy. I cut her off because I was sick of letting me lose my mind just so she could feel comfortable. Our friends are mad because she won't talk to them. AITA? (We're ages 21 to 22.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have an ex-friend who was obsessed with wanting to find a bad boy. She found one online in my city and moved down here. He used to identify as an incel. He calls me racial slurs and says women are only good for cooking, cleaning, and raising kids. He unironically calls himself a thug and tries to intimidate everybody. He thinks I'm just too ""low IQ"" to admit he's right.

They've accused me before of not wanting her to be happy. I just don't want to be called racial slurs. And I don't want to see him in the hospital or prison with that mouth of his. He's alienated her from me multiple times over the past year, claiming I'm trying to get with her. The man made her wear long pants and a jacket on New Year's Eve in case his family got ""jealous"".

I told her yesterday that I'm done dealing with them, and her boyfriend rattled off about how I'm just a thug who wants to steal ""females"". I ignored him and told her that I was done mentally exhausting myself for her personal comfort.

Our friend group is mad at me because she won't talk to them at all. My friends said I took it too far, and that I should've been nicer about it instead of implying she's manipulative. AITA? I feel that while she's in a bad position, my health comes first, but they see that as selfish.","False","Not the A-hole","4","25"
"eji33p","1578070380","AITA for getting my daughter a car even though her mother asked me not to and not letting her older daughter drive it?","
Shes a good kid and pretty responsible. So I was going to get her a car now that she can drive. I also thought it would make it easier for her to get to school and back and forth between her moms and mine. I never really liked her having to take the bus all the time. They’re kind of sketchy in our area and it gets dark really early when she’s still out and about.

When I brought it up with her mom she asked me not to because her other daughter who is older would be upset about my her younger sister having a car when she doesn’t and it would create issues. That didn’t seem like a reasonable reason to me.

So I didn’t end up getting her anything super new or expensive, but it’s safe and a good first car. I also made sure she had insurance and AAA. 

As my daughters mother predicted though her older daughter was upset. She said it would be better if they shared the car.

I said no to that because legally the car is mine and I don’t want someone I don’t know or trust driving it. My daughters mom said “really, you can’t just help me make this easier” and hung up on me after that.

Edit. My daughters moms older daughter is not also my daughter. Their mom and I were never married or in a relationship together.

Our daughter has also mostly lived with me for the past 3 years and doesn’t want to share her car either.","1578092386.0","Not the A-hole","1297","593"

However, he constantly emails me on my off-hours and in the past has said: ""I know I email you on off hours but just ignore them and respond when you're working"". Lately, however, I've been getting emails that say phrases like ""respond ASAP"" or ""send me answer tonight"" 

Multiple times after emailing me he'll text me also requesting that answer to which I've replied I'm not working right now but will respond when I am. Often times I'm working on other work or am not physically home. 

It's gotten to the point where I just don't respond if he emails me outside of work hours because he continually emails me anywhere from an hour outside my work hours to 8pm or on a Sunday (I work Mon-Wed only for him). I know he's getting annoyed at me but even after telling him I have other jobs and can't be on call for him at all times (not to mention he expects me to respond on my time not on the clock).

If people are in my home with me, they're there to spend time with me or with other people. They're not there to sit around and scroll through their phones or whatever.

I don't have people staying over at my house or anything like that. People are there for maybe 3-4 hours tops. It's my opinion that anyone without a serious mental addiction should be able to get through that time without connecting to wifi. There's perfectly good cell service at my place, too. 

This became an issue this week when I had a small NYE gathering. One of the people brought their kids with them and asked for the wifi so they could put a game on a tablet for the kids. I told the person no, if the kids are here, they should be interacting with the rest of us (FYI, this wasn't a drinking/drug party), not sitting with their faces in a device, and if the parent didn't want them to be a part of the gathering, they shouldn't have brought the kids.

She said she was down and wanted to do everything I usually do. I’m pretty jacked. I warned her that my full body workout might be too hard for her, but she’s a determined cookie. 


The hotel gym only has dumbbells up to 50 lbs so I’m not getting much of a sweat in. I do 3 sets of 10 reps for each lift. I pretty much max out on each exercise while my sister used like 20 lb dumbbells for chest press and 10 lb dumbbells for skullcrushers.

"ejikpq","1578072430","AITA for making my roommate move out?","First ever post, sorry for any errors. I can't quite fit everything in here, so if you have questions please feel free to ask.

Several months ago I (M21), along with my dog, moved in with a friend (F20) of mine to a new house we rented together. We had both been looking separately for our own places, but agreed we'd be a good fit to get our own place together as we had been good friends for awhile and got along great.

About a month after we moved in, she asked if she could get a cat. I was cool with it, but about 2 days after she asked she arrived home with **two** cats. I had asked that she get a pet gate to keep their food and litter boxes separate from my dog, which didn't happen.

Next, her new bf started staying over nearly every night and staying by himself during the day while we were gone. She even got him a key to the house. To me, having him and his (unannounced) buddies over all the time was already enough, but giving him unlimited access to the place was too much. That and the fact that he wasn't paying for anything, either. I ended up spending most of my nights shut in my bedroom with my dog, and when we went out of my room I had to keep him on a leash so he wouldn't get into the garbage and cat stuff that was left out during the day. Eventually, he brought drugs in to the house and started keeping them there. Weed is one thing, acid is another.

This all came to a head when I had a small party. The only issue that ever arose was that many of my friends were also her friends that she also worked with and her relationship with her bf was being kept secret to ""avoid drama"". Everything was cleared beforehand, but just as my friends showed up, I got a text from my her that they no longer wanted me to have anyone over. Shortly after that, she sent back another text stating that she changed her mind again, but that she didn't want anyone from her work being there. As you can guess, one of the two people already here was a coworker, who she had just said earlier was cool to bring by when I first asked. Eventually, she walked out and saw us on the couch. She went back to her room and sent a text: ""Why is X here? I asked you for this one thing and now (BF) is really uncomfortable here."" I texted back telling her that she agreed first that they could be here, and that her flip-flopping on which of my friends could or couldn't be here while she was shut in her room was totally unfair.

The next day she met me in the living room where she said that she didn't think this was working out and very strongly hinted that I should move out. I told her that I couldn't just pick up and move again. I asked why, and she said that she wanted her bf to move in. I put my foot down and refused to move, saying that I wasn't going to move just to make her happy. I offered several times to work things out, but she refused to work with me.

Within two weeks she had moved out and into a new place with her bf.

I’m 25 years old and due to various reasons I still live at home with my parents. I have a full time job in which I save money and contribute to the house in any way possible/ asked of me. I currently have no car and spend around 60$ a week to get from and back from work.I have a younger brother who’s close to graduating high school. He’s 17 and doesn’t have a job but he’s not a bad kid. Here’s my situation. My parents have recently come across a car a family friend is selling for a reasonable price. Upon learning of this I decided to make my mom an offer and buy the car off her. I also told her I’ll pay for any cost at the DMV along with being able to pay my monthly insurance and for any gas usage. My mom then informs me that she’s planning on leaving the car for my brother and once I asked about financial questions in maintaining the car since my brother doesn’t work I was informed she will pay for his gas usage and his insurance. Confused I asked her why she wouldn’t take the offer of letting me buy it off her along with being able to financially care for the car and it’s usage knowing that by giving it to my brother she then has the extra burden of maintaining it for him. She also knows how much I spend to be able to make It to work.
I’m confused about this whole situation . I don’t want to seem like an asshole especially because I know I’m older but a part of me seems it’s unfair they would give my brother a gift like this for free when I’m offering cash for something they know I drastically need too.

I'm aware of how Type A this sounds, but I really think it would help her. I just don't know if it's the right tone for a birthday present. I'm definitely going to ask her permission first but I'm afraid I WBTA just for asking... does it come across as mean-spirited or judge-y? I await your judgement.

&#x200B;

So this situation does require a bit of background information. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for about  year now, and had a bit of a rough patch that I though we had overcome. Back in September, I asked him if I could use his laptop to do work for a class, he said yes, and when I opened it up, there was a picture of a girl in a bikini saved on his desktop. No, I did not have to open anything up to find this, it was literally just saved on his desktop. When i asked him about it, he became really flustered and told me that it was some girl he had went to high school with and he accidentally saved it off of her FaceBook and he was just looking at old friends and seeing what they were up to. Obviously, this was a lie, and after about a week the whole story had unraveled. The picture was not of an old friend but of the girl he had a one time hookup with and lost his virginity to. It turns out he had been going onto her FaceBook to masterbate over the past two months and decided to just save a picture so he didn't have to keep looking up her profile. Our relationship is his first true relationship and he seemed to have no idea how much this would upset and hurt me.

&#x200B;

We had a lot of discussions about it and in the end we decided to stay together, since I honestly believe he did not know what he was doing would upset me, and he swore to be honest going forward. It took about until the beginning of November for me to really feel comfortable and that he wasn't hiding anything from me and wasn't doing that anymore. He had given me no reason to believe he was and had honestly proven himself to have realized his mistakes and move forward from them.

&#x200B;

That leads us up to the current situation and my AITA question. A few days ago while we were having a conversation, my BF very easily and with no second thought lied to me about something. I know for a fact it was a lie, but did not confront him at the time. That lie has been festering in my head since then, and this morning when he left for work, I logged onto his computer and checked his FaceBook search history to see if he had been looking up that same girl at all.

&#x200B;

He hasn't.

&#x200B;

Now I am stuck in my head over whether I was justified in what I did because of him lying and our past situations or if I am just an asshole for not respecting his privacy.

"ejisgf","1578073349","AITA for not letting a man, his wife and three kids and 10 bags of luggage check in before me?","So first time poster. Absolutely horrific story writer. So give me some slack.

Background: This happened earlier today at the airport. I am by myself with my girls (age 1 and 4) and am having to check my luggage in. One big luggage bag and a storage container (one of those 20 gallon plastic bins at target stuffed with Xmas in it).

If you’ve ever traveled with young kids and a stroller by yourself, you know what a pain it is. But I get my self check tags, move my luggage to the front of the line (there were tons of people standing around but nobody was in line.).  And then I go back to where my mom is waiting (at the front door) to get my kids (in a stroller) and all of the sudden I have this guy blocking my way. This was maybe all of ten or fifteen feet. My mom was making sure I got everything settled before she hopped back in her car.

I finally get around him and he asks me if he can go in front of me since he’s been waiting for 10 minutes. Mind you, I saw him checking in his stuff at the same time as mine at a self service kiosk, but he wasn’t in line yet. He was messing with his luggage and kids because he didn’t know where to go with it. 

I said no. I had two bags, it was going to take me two minutes (which it did) and it wouldn’t make sense. He literally had two carts full of stuff. So he asks me again and then let’s me know he has three kids (they were older - around 8, 10 and probably 12). 

So I told him, that I have two kids and I’m traveling by myself, so the answer is no. He then replies, oh you want an award lady? So I replied, right back at you buddy.

I felt like I was just pointing out the obvious. You have your wife and three kids that are old enough they can help you, but I should wait for your 20 bags to go ahead of me because you got there earlier in the day and was wandering around? 

So give it to me straight - AITA?

Edit - to clarify I did NOT leave my bags for 10 minutes, I turned around to see my mother walking in the door with my kids and got the stroller and pushed them forward - literally 10 seconds later. He saw that she was coming to help me check the bags and that’s obviously why he lined up behind me. Also, He stated he had been in the airport for the past ten minutes, not in line for that time all. There wasn’t even an agent when I put my bags down, and when I turned around she was coming to help me.  It’s not easy to push two kids, plus luggage, plus your carryons. 

Edit 2- next time I’ll just have my mother walk in the airport and then I won’t lose my place in creating a line.

Edit 3 - Everyone was just hanging around there wasn’t a clear line anywhere, because there was no agent.  She showed up only as I was moving my stuff to where I thought I should drop them off since I had self-tagged them.

Edit 4 - just to be clear, if he would have said, hey lady you cut me off, I would have apologized and let him go ahead of me no problem.","1578089330.0","Not the A-hole","2657","518"
"ejiuuj","1578073623","AITA for refusing to let my employer give me a performance review?","I am a domestic servant/au pair (combination live-in nanny and housekeeper) caring for an infant and a four year old. I am essentially their sole caregiver, in addition to handling the household chores (cooking, cleaning, etc.) and light household maintenance (mowing the lawn, fixing the broken toilet flapper, etc). I really feel like I excel in my role, which is evident by how much the kids are thriving. 

However, my employer now feels strongly that there should be assigned metrics to my work (particularly with the four year old and the household maintenance), and we should be doing a corresponding “formal performance review process” in which we discuss my performance goals for 2020, I receive a performance rating for 2019, and penalties for not meeting performance targets are delineated. 

I found this extremely surprising and rather insulting, since I’m fantastic with the kids and keeping the house up well, and I’ve already mentioned feeling under compensated for my work many times (my employer guarantees covering my room and board, but any additional pocket money is at his discretion). 

On the one hand I understand that this comes from a good place, my employer also runs two small businesses very well and emphasizes continual two-way feedback (as he puts it) with the staff he employs outside his home, so he feels I shouldn’t be “exempt” from that process just because of where I work. He says I'm being ""entitled"" and ""self-centered"" to think I'm above having to go through a performance review when that's something that comes with almost any job. But on the other hand, I feel like a lot of what he is discussing will end up hurting our already strained relationship. Domestic care is really difficult to “quantify” and put metrics to, and the idea of my employer saying “I counted thirteen tantrums from the four year old in December, which exceeds the limit of three per week, so you’ve missed your emotional control metric for him” just seems so crazy and unreasonable. 

So far I’ve been refusing to sit for my “performance review” and changing the subject when he brings it up. Although he could technically fire me, it is prohibitively expensive for him to replace me, so I’m not worried about that. Still, he told me today it’s “an asshole move” to dodge him about this, that “everyone has a boss” and I’m just being childish refusing to deal with it. I will add that in every job I’ve had before this one, I willingly sat for my yearly review. It’s just the domestic help situation that I think makes this weird and unnecessary.

We’re going to do some couples counselling to address insecurities on both our parts. The ring actually fits perfectly on my middle finger, so I’m going to wear it like that until the summer. Thank you for your help!

My fiancé proposed to me recently and gave me a beautiful pearl ring that was ordered from Etsy. 

The issue is that I rarely wear jewelry and I’m always in a mad scramble in the mornings so I forget to wear it about half the time still. I’ve always been a forgetful person but I am trying to improve.

My fiancé gets very upset when I forget because it makes him feel like I am not excited about the engagement and that I am not sure about marrying him.

None of that is true because I love him very much and I am excited to marry him. It’s just that, since I am not used to jewelry, I find wearing the ring slightly uncomfortable. And since it was ordered online, it’s maybe 1/4 or so too big, so it might benefit from a little resizing. I’m a little hesitant still to get resized since my fingers may swell a little more in the summer so I’m holding off for now.

He got really angry at me last night and has been texting me today apologizing for yelling but he states that he’s really hurting because of me forgetting to wear the ring. I’ve apologized for forgetting but my stance is that I’m not doing it on purpose and I’m trying my best to remember to wear it so I don’t understand why he can’t give me more time to adjust. He thinks I’m making excuses and there must be a deeper reason for me forgetting, but there really isn’t.

"ejj0ad","1578074248","AITA for being unhappy about accomodation arrangements?","Hi there, I’m on vacation with my family overseas at the moment, and I was hoping I could get some perspective on the situation I’m facing right now. I’m on holiday with my parents, my grandmother and my sister. My sister and I paid for our flights, my parents took care of accomodation.

My parents booked a serviced apartment for this leg of our vacation, which was meant to have at least 3 bedrooms for the rest of my family, and a pull out couch for me in the living room. When we arrived today, the company that we booked through told us we were being upgraded to a luxury apartment- 3 bedrooms, but no pull out couch. Instead they arranged for a small bed to be placed in the walk-in closet for me to sleep in. The problem with this is that the closet is set up with a motion sensor that turns on some led light strips and down lights, so there’s no way to have complete darkness, meaning sleep is going to be tricky for the next few nights. The closet of course doesn’t have air conditioning or a space heater at all, and given that it’s winter where I am for this holiday, that’s going to be a problem. 

I was really unhappy with this situation. I didn’t get outwardly angry but my parents could see from my facial expressions that I was not happy about how this all came to be. I can’t help but feel left out or forgotten, and it sucks that I have to go through other people’s bedrooms in order to have a shower or use the bathroom, since this is the way the apartment has been set up. 

My parents got fed up with me and told me that they’ll take the bed (not possible as it’s a single bed and I wouldn’t want them being uncomfortable anyway), and my sister was getting angry at me for how I felt about the situation too. I asked to borrow her eye mask to help solve the lighting situation, and she’s given me one (with great hesitation- she says my head looks big enough to stretch the elastic band for it). My grandma also offered to switch, but she’s 76 and I’d never forgive myself if I made her sleep in a closet at her age.

At one point when we were out having lunch, my sister and I were trying to make the best of the situation by joking about how I’m almost like Harry Potter, sleeping in a closet when he had a cupboard under the stairs, and my dad got angry at me and said that it’s better than sleeping on the street. I think this point doesn’t make sense, since we’re in a luxury apartment, but I held my tongue instead of talking back to him. We all make decent money working (except for my sister as she’s just finished university and doesn’t work full-time) and I would have been happy to put cash towards accomodation if it meant I could get a bedroom for this part of the journey.

My friend, a huge football fan who truly believes that no one else is more knowledgeable of the sport than he is, started a fantasy football league. The buy in was $20 and when he asked me to join I told him I wouldn't pay now because I planned on winning (cocky, much?) and that I'd hand over the $20 if I failed to do so. He agreed and and collected $20 from enough people to have a full league. Something like $200 was the full pot, I can't remember exactly. This was a big deal back then, early 20s, minimum wage workers.

So the league began, and things go well for both of us, but eventually my team whups his teams ass in the championship. This is where shit gets fucky. I ask for the money and he tells me I get nothing because I never paid like everyone else. I reminded him that he agreed and he continued to refuse payment.

Last week, my relatives came over to celebrate Christmas with us and my mom wouldn't stop pointing out her acne marks and scars to our relatives and constantly would tell everyone to not let Alya eat sugar.

Alya instantly retracted her had and looked completely humiliated. When I was around her age, I also had to deal with acne that left marks on my face and it demolished my confidence. I had always wished I had something to coverup my scars when I was going out. I decided to take it upon myself to buy her a little bit of foundation to help her.

My mom is also very vocal about not wearing makeup if you have acne, but I don't think she understands how much Alya's acne is bothering her.

I got it in highschool because it was what I could afford and I wasn't expecting it to last too long. But eight years later it's still going strong. I'm a mechanical engineer and I can do a lot of the maintenance and fixes myself now, so it's been really cheap to maintain. It's stick shift which makes it pretty reliable too. 

It's had some accidents, one that dented up the hood before I bought it, one sideswipe from a drunk driver that just caused cosmetic damage, one time it was rear ended on a snowy day and I had to replace the back panel of the bodywork. 

It looks well worn too, someone who owned it in the past must have been a chain smoker because there's plenty of little burn marks and discoloration.

But it's mine, it's special to me, I call it my adventure wagon and have taken it traveling all over the country. I know it well and it taught me a lot about maintenance.

Anyway, I work at a techie company in a city, and it's a place a lot of people don't need to drive since there's great public transportation. 

A few of my coworkers, John and Tim, were going to a conference along with me. Our boss thought none of us had cars and suggested expensing a rental car, but he seemed stressed about the cost and was waffling on whether to even send us. Then I said I have a car, I just don't take it to work very often, but I could drive to save the team some money. He said absolutely, and I'd get reimbursed for gas and tolls plus a little extra for wear and tear.

So we got going to the conference in my car. John, who's a friend of mine, had no problems with my car. But Tim, who I don't know too well, but I know he tends to ramble on about stuff, just started complaining, and complaining, and complaining.

It shakes when it goes... Is this as fast as it'll go... It does not shift smoothly... Is this a burn mark here... You're using a casette??? I want to listen to something else...

I was getting annoyed, and I didn't really acknowledge his rambling and turned up the music. He started complaining about how shit the speakers are.

I turned around and was like ""tell me about your car? Oh right, you don't have one. Don't complain if you don't have anything better to offer."" 

He said that he didn't get one because he took the subway, but if I was gonna have a car, why didn't I get a decent one? Mine seemed like a death trap, it was noisy and uncomfortable, 

I said that it was a normal car and he was acting real entitled for someone who didn't even have a car, like he could talk after he got off the subway and started driving.

I never get angry but I was fed up of her dropping me when she didn’t need me and as soon as she did need me pick me back up. I just thought ‘don’t seem needed, let her move on if she doesn’t want to talk to you’

12 months later

‘Friend Request’

I accept her request and then 5 min later get a message from her, we start having a nice conversation. Over the 12 Months she had a LOT go on, she got engaged, and she ALSO, had her child baptised as I looked through her photos to sneak a peak of the baby and noticed ‘baby and godmother’ photo.

I was gutted and hurt, she blatantly lied to me about having the child baptised and couldn’t tell me to my face.

Noticed you had your little one baptised in the end :-) he’s adorable!

‘Yeah, was a last minute decision, planned it in a day.’

Now, I’m trying to plan a wedding at the moment. I’m pretty sure that you cannot plan a baptism in a day... you cannot just turn up to a church and get your baby baptised as far as Im aware.. she had lied to me and just didn’t want me in her life.

I wanted to unload my frustration on her. But I didnt. I told her I was happy for her and wished her and the family the best. I removed her from Facebook.

I realised whenever she hung out with me it was when my life was worse than hers, when I needed her as a friend and didn’t have anyone else. When I met my first partner she left me, when we broke up she came back, she then dropped me because she didn’t want me. then when she did she came back.

And I feel like we cannot discuss anything other than their issues.  I also feel like they only reach out to me when they need to discuss issues and not to just hang. 

So a couple of weeks ago, I told them both that I'm going away for an unspecified time and that I won't be able to use my phone much and that they will not be able to contact me. At this time, one of them was going through another dramatic period in their relationship.

She switched her entire moral compass and political views to have a relationship without drama because she has no self-esteem. I kinda thought my brother was long over his 
racism just until this week apparently. 


   I caught them both at a family gathering ""joking"" (AKA pretending their racism is funny so people can laugh it off). First, they were NEAR my son and my brother was saying some vile garbage about black people that he personally knew. I mean unnecessary rude and racist stuff.  I was in shock just listening with my arms crossed. Then the fiance directly turns to my son seeing as he heard it all. But to my surprise she starts making silly jokes about race and gays with my son. She said the picture he drew looked like it was for the gays. Then she asked the name of his new friends - ""what are they black?!?!"" in a very disgusted voice. Now luckily my son is very bright and is exceptionally smart for his age. He just looked at her like she was a creep. 


    I did not ask kindly for them to stop. Nope. I slammed my hands down on the table and told them off. I know I said a curse word in front of my kid, but I was infuriated at how racist they are. Just how does anyone think trying to get MY KID to repeat their garbage is somehow funny? Why anyone in my family even laughs at them, but never tells them off is beyond me. Why I bit my tongue and didn't snap sooner, also beyond me. Just unbelievable. 


   I contemplated just keeping my son from them because they obviously have some serious issues. The problem is my son loves all his family and I don't want him to be upset. I just really trusted my own family more than to do something as dumb as that. I also thought they were becoming better people. I honeslty think they wanted to piss me off for fun, but there's no doubt they are just disgusting racist garbage. 
   Some people in my family write it off as ""they just have bad humor"" or some BS. Sure, talking about hitting someone for being black is a joke, sure.

However when I moved in, it smelled like BO, old fast food, and general mustiness. I didn't really say anything because it was labor day weekend and mess happens. I thought it was going to be cleaned up. I was wrong. 

Over the next 4 months or so I would clean up the common space only for him to trash it. He leaves trash bags by the door ""to take down in the morning"" (we are a third floor walk up) but never does and let's dishes covered in food sit in the sink for weeks at a time or until I clean it. 

I'm sick of the common space being destroyed all the time and not being able to cook my own food.

The problem is no one else in my family likes Indian food except my mom and I. Our solution was that my mom and I would go alone to the restaurant on my actual birthday - Monday - and on Sunday or Saturday, we’d have family and friends over for a small gathering with alcohol, cake etc.

For those who asked why the Indian restaurant had anything t do with vegetarianism, I live in a small ish city with few restaurants with any vegetarian options or just 1 or 2 tops.

Recently, my boyfriend went on a trip with his guy friends. It's a yearly trip and in the past the mother of one of the guys used to make them a specific snack but was too old(? Not entirely sure what the reason was) this year.

So one evening when we have had two or three beers already he told me about the snack and asked if I would do it for them. I have never made this specific food nor do I really like it. Which I told him. I said something along the lines that I am wondering why they couldn't do it himself and that I would prefer making something different to which he didn't really say anything and dropped the topic.

My main reason why I didn't feel like doing it, is that he or one of his friends is perfectly capable to do it himself and I feel like I've only been asked because I am female. I don't even know his friends since they are all from different regions. 
On the other hand it is only a small favor and to be honest cooking isn't one of his biggest strengths.

One of her new year's resolutions was to start going with me at least once a month. Yesterday was the very first time she actually asked me to take her instead of her usual comments of wanting to go one day, or when some problems resolve.

I don't blame her for waiting since she has some legitimate health problems but I kindly explained that I don't go to the gym in January. She seemed mildly confused but seemed to accept it until she asked why.

I explained to her during January the gym is usually loaded with people who are trying to get healthy this year and it will be filled to the brim and there would be a crazy long wait to get into the massage beds or showers once we get done so it's better to go to a nearby park that has a track of a nice walking trail.

She wanted to know what would make February any different so, not thinking I gave her the honest reason that 90% of them won be there by that point, they'll either give up completely or move to diets, trails, or some fad thing as they aren't getting results fast enough while the few that remain will find a set schedule for not be there quite as often giving us room to move around and use what we want when we feel like it instead of having to wait for 50 people to use the treadmills for 10 minutes then go home or spend an hour tanning and getting a massage... Unfortunately all things I've personally witnessed twice so it's not like I was shitting on a group of people I never actually dealt with. 

She immediately changed her mind and told me that she would just stick to walking because she didn't want to go with someone that ""antisocial"" and would probably ""just be in my way"" and gave me a lecture on how all of those people just wanted to better themselves and I should try to help and encourage them instead of avoid them and treat them like a problem.

I simply wanted to explain why starting in January is a bad idea and that she'd get the best experience waiting until the phase ended but my dad called later to tell me I should have took her, let her see for herself and come to her own conclusions. He was semi neutral in the matter accusing her of over reacting and me of speaking before before I thought because she's failed in the past, several times and now feels like I called her out and said she has a ""90% chance of falling so there's no point to even try""

She says it is the smell and consistency but mostly the smell. She gets physically sick. For the most part it is just annoying. They aren’t really big deals at the house. She will buy them for us to eat and just leave the room when we consume them or step away. If she can’t or smell them (like at a restaurant with a lot of smells or when we cook in the kitchen and we can hid it in a bun or she can set away from it at the table). If she smells it she will gag or throw up and looks really pale. She talked to her doctor once and he just told her that some people were more sensitive to certain smells than others and he generally just suggested not going around that smell. 

During the holidays we took a long road trip and on the way home the kids wanted to stop for dinner. We really wanted to get home to make an event my wife needed to attend for work so my wife drove while the kids and I ate some carry out in the car. She wasn’t hungry. My youngest got a ketchup packet and opened it. She rolled down his window but that set the oldest off wanting ketchup and then I wanted ketchup too. She didn’t seem mad at the kids but she told me she was upset at me for disrespecting the fact that I joined in with the kids while we were in a enclosed place she couldn’t get away from the smell since I was sitting right next to her. 

She eventually had to pull over and get out of the car at a station. She looked stayed out of the car until the kids and I finished eating and helped us clean up the car and get the smell out. She was still feeling sick after so I took over driving and she spent about 10 minutes with her head near the window.

We later talked about her thinking I was disrespectful because she said I knew she would have an issue because the space was so enclosed. She said the kids are one thing but I should know better. I don’t think I did anything wrong because she is often over dramatic about the smells and the eating lasted a brief time. She was the one who didn’t want to stop. I voted for stopping.  We were a little late getting home because she had to pull over. She ended up not going to the work event anyway. She wouldn’t even have been late to it (we got home in enough time to spare).

About a year or two ago, my mom started frequently complimenting me (F, if that's important) on my weight and my looks. (Constantly calling me skinny, nothing else on my weight, *just* skinny. Just general compliments on other aspects of my appearance.) At first I appreciated the compliments, despite a *slight* uncomfortability. Now, I've realized that her constant complimenting makes me very uncomfortable for 4 reasons.  
1. It's always in front of people that are sensitive about their appearance. In my family of five, there are three people that are sensitive about their appearance. I'm not sensitive about it, it's just that the compliments are always in front of these three. I am the only person in my family that she compliments frequently. I'll get into that later.  
2. I am the favorite child. It's really obvious, and I hate it. I don't want another reason for my siblings to hate me even more than they probably already do.  
3. I feel like my mom isn't complimenting me for the sake of complimenting me, I think it's because she's compensating for herself. You know how I mentioned that over half of our family is sensitive about their appearance? My mom is one of them. She is very insecure about her own weight, and I feel like she is projecting that insecurity by complimenting me.   
4. It's just very uncomfortable in general.  


You may be asking, why can't I just tell her? I'm afraid that she's gonna pull the ""Oh, I guess I just can't compliment my kids anymore"" card. I don't want to hurt her feelings, and if I do, I'll feel terrible forever.

I know there's been a lot of drama recently, my aunt had a messy divorce and then she moved onto another guy very quickly.

My sister got married to a guy with 3 kids and it's a little weird because she's not really the parent type so she's their stepmom but not really being an equal co-parent

My other aunt and uncle just seem to be fighting a lot, the gossip is that someone cheatd? 

I mostly stay out of this, but my mom will gossip to me on the phone sometimes. I'm not too interested in gossip but once she gets rambling she's hard to stop lol.

Anyway, I'm pretty insulated from the drama because I live quite far away. And I know I've gotta grin and bear it a little around holidays but that's for a very limited time. 

--+-

Now, onto the problem. 

I always thought it was good ettiquite to never give someone's cell phone number out without their permission. Like, it's not publically listed, it's not something people want anyone to have. It's awkward getting an unexpected text or call from someone you know you would not want to talk to. 

You just don't do that without asking. Like if someone wants my friends number, I'll tell them I'll pass their number on to my friends instead.

But after Christmas this year, it seems like my dad gave my number to a bunch of people. 

My aunt's new husband texted me asking for photos I'd taken on my phone over Christmas.

My sister's husband's son whos 7 and has his first phone has been sending me meme after meme.

My other aunt has called me to say that my mom wasn't picking up the phone, and could I tell her where she was and when she'd be ready to talk? It sounded like there was some drama or conflict going on, and I said I just don't know where my mom is or why she's not answering her phone.

I felt like my dad crossed a big line, so I told him that I was upset he'd given my phone number to a bunch of people without asking me. That was really rude and was putting me in an awkward situation. I didn't want to be pulled into whatever family BS was going on, but I felt like it would come off bad to not pick up our reply.

I said it was just basic ettiquite to ask before giving out a phone number. 

My dad got mad about that, he said I was irritable about every little thing; that ""my generation"" is so sheltered they can't even deal with an unexpected call. That it's family, not some telemarketer. 

I said it was about courtesy and respect, it's basic respect that most people expect of each other.

My dad was like ""I don't know who those people are but you're the one being disrespectful of me""

So my (F20) older sibling (F25) has been sick with influenza b for about 5 days and is still experiencing symptoms. She lives with her partner and didn't want to be home alone while he worked. She thought it would be a good idea to come over to visit my parents' place today. I live here along with two younger siblings. One is a teenager, and the other is a preteen. 

Anyway, I did not know she had influenza b until she showed up, and I greeted her at the door. I just knew she was sick, but she never told us what it was until after I questioned her. So she brought a bag of bagels. She said she took one but can't keep food down, she said she didn't want them to go to waste. 

So I'm still a little hesitant about being around her because she's sick and she's coughing and sneezing. And I tell her this. I tell her that influenza b is contagious, and I leave the implication hanging... Perhaps she shouldn't be here in this condition. The kids are just getting better from a cold they had during Christmas. 

So she got kind of upset and went on to tell me that her partner is fine and that she has even kissed him, and he's okay. She joked that she would cough on me. 

And so I guess I'm the paranoid one. She told my parents how I was being with her. Her and my parents started teasing me about how they're just gonna ""grab me"" and have her cough on me.

I was looking for a place to live, and a friend of mine owned a house. She needed some help with bills due to some issues at work (I think her hours got cut) and asked if I would like to rent a room. It was a good deal and close to work, so I did.

Everything went great for about ten months. One day, she mentioned that her sister was coming into town, and that she would be staying with us. I didn't have a problem with this. However, it turned out that the sister had four children between the ages of two and eleven. What's more, it became apparent over time that the sister and her children were less staying to visit as much as they were moving in permanently. The sister didn't have a job, and the kids' various fathers were entirely absent.

After several months, I'd had enough and found an apartment. The sister and I never got along, and the kids were constantly looking for attention (of course, they're kids.)

After the huge majority of responses told me to stick up for myself the next time the argument was brought up, I did exactly that. I told him that I'm an adult woman at 21 years old and he had no right to treat me the way he was, like a disobedient child. I told him that there was nothing wrong with BF staying with me and that he needed to get out of his archaic state of mind about it because what was done was done (me losing my virginity) and there is nothing he can do about it.

He kept ranting about how he was angry with me for sleeping with BF and how ""anything can go wrong"" and he ""expected more of me"", and I eventually got so angry that I told him his toxic obsession with my virginity/my sexual activity and genitalia made him sound like a creep, and he needs to stop.

Saying this struck a nerve and he stormed off and didn't talk to me for a few hours, but a while ago he came up to me and told me that if I so desperately want BF to stay in my room with me then I can do so, but our relationship will be very different and very broken if I do so I should consider that a warning.

Now that I've had some time to calm down I'm absolutely heartbroken. Myself and my dad are very close, I've always been closer to him than my mom, so I'm shocked he threatened me by saying my relationship with him is on the line.

BF is coming to visit tomorrow and I'm still lost as to what to do for sleeping arrangements, and my mom is upset with me for letting the fight with my dad get to that point and says I'm TA for agreeing to not want a relationship with him just to get my way. AITA?

I’m in highschool and we get a junior prom, little less formal than senior prom but still a big deal. 
Sorry for length 

Cast: 
Me - guess
A - (friend) 
C -crush 
E - best friend, friends with C and A 

So A asked me to go to prom with her “as friends” and I agreed because I didn’t wanna sound mean and say no. She texts me 2 weeks later saying “if neither of us have dates before jan, we’re going together” I said ok, and thought nothing of it since she probably would leave me for a hotter date. My best friend knew I had a crush on C, and she was best friends with her, she was rooting for me when I asked her to prom. 
Jan 1st comes and as part of the new year I ask C to prom. She is extremely excited, and tells her mum, and her and I are so happy. Then E texts me saying “did you forget to tell A that you planned to ask C?” 
I replied “oh it shouldn’t be that big of a deal, A will understand right? I like C a lot and A knew how lonely I’ve been.” 
3 minutes later E tells me that A is crying since A told her FREAKING MOTHER, AND ENTIRE FAMILY THAT SHE WAS GOING WITH ME. Keep in mind, E and myself had a theory that A had a crush on me, I didn’t like her back. 
I call A, after telling C the whole situation. A calls me crying her fucking ass off, like she lost a relative. In my head I’m thinking “it’s junior prom, let me go with this girl, I like her a lot, why are you crying.” I try to talk to her, and she just shouts insults at me saying that I never cared about her and completely blew her off. keep in mind we aren’t dating, we’re just friends, and she knows I can get her a new prom date in a heartbeat. 
She hangs up after calling me a d*khead and a**hole. So I report back to C and my mum.

So the other day I have done the same, and when my flatmate saw me do that he completely freaked out and we ended up having a big argument about it.

She, Lydia, is as difficult a child as can be imagined - not fully potty trained, hits, nonverbal, etc. I could be making more than double doing the same work for a private company, but because I care about this girl and her family, I have chosen to stay and work for very little money and no health insurance.

I am also a full time student, and so my hours depend on my class schedule. Fall semester I was working or in class 7 days a week, while studying for the MCAT. This lead to a mental breakdown and I decided, to my mental health, to take Sundays off.

A few weeks ago I let my boss know my new hours, and stressed that I would like to maintain my Sundays off. She refused, because she would have no help with Lydia, and offered a shorter day. I agreed. Next semester I would work Sundays.

Meanwhile, I have been enjoying my Sundays off and made plans for this Sunday with a friend who is moving to japan on Monday. My boss texted me a schedule with me on for Sunday, and when I explained I would not be working, she blew up on me, saying she had bent over backwards to accommodate me (she has, but so have I - coming in early when Lydia had diarrhea at school, etc) and why wasn't I sticking to our scheduled agreement. I apologized, and said I had thought we were not starting until the semester started, and agreed to come in.

In the first six months after I came out, my dad told me I have bad genes, I'm unnatural, I have a problem, and a mental illness. 

We got into an argument six months ago. He denied all the homophobic comments he's made to me about my sexuality; except the one about me being unnatural. He called me that one a few more times. The argument ended with him storming off. Since that day, I have given my dad the cold shoulder, one word answers, dirty looks, the whole sha-bang.

My mom had a talk with my dad following the argument, and since that talk they had, my dad has been on his best behavior. He started treating me really well. He used to be an old grumpy man that locked himself up in his garage. Now he hangs out with my mom, calls my sister more often, and even invites the neighbors over like he's fucking Mr. Rogers or something.

I think it's great that my dad has changed for the better, but I am still very bitter and resentful towards him for two reasons:
1. He still hasn't apologized or even acknowledged that what he said to me was wrong.
2. His good behavior doesn't change how he thinks/feels about me.

My mom and sister have told me that I should forgive and forget what my dad told me, but what is there to forgive if he hasn't apologized or acknowledged anything he's said? I tried to explain to them that what he told me really hurt, but they insist that he didn't really mean what he said. That puts me in a difficult position to trust my dad because what if I start building a relationship with him again and he says more homophobic stuff to me? How am I supposed to tell what he really does or doesn't mean?

My mom and my sister think I'm the asshole because I couldn't put my feelings aside for the Holidays and pretend to be one big happy family. I honestly don't care though, I don't like my dad. Aside from just being gay, my dad has verbally abused me my whole life. The homophobia was just the last straw. I used to feel guilty about it in the past, but I actually like the resentment now. It's motivating me to move out and hopefully by this summer I'll have enough to actually do it, and if I do, do it, it might be the last time I ever speak to my dad.

My mum let slip that their will would have to be changed now my sister has 2 children. She said that the inheritance will now be split 4 ways instead of 2.

I like to think I'm not a materialistic person, but the message this sends to me has hurt me.

In my experience inheretences should be equally split amongst children and then they can pass to their children as they see fit.

The way my mum's would work is I would stand to get a quarter of the estate, and my sister would get 3 quarters (with a clause for a half of that to be split amongst her children when they are of age).

The way I see this is that I am worth less to my parents as I dont have any children currently. And if (god forbid) anything did happen to them in the immediate future and I hadn't had children by then, their future grandchildren would be at a loss.

I dont know how to bring this up with them and tell them they've hurt me a bit by potentially giving a larger sum to my sister as she has children, albeit with clauses.

I will not bring this up whilst my mum is grieving, but WIBTA if I did mention it in the future?

EDIT: just to clarify, the issue isnt with the split of money per se, I wanted to raise that it might be sensible for them to split it on a percentage basis for the grandchildren.
For example 50/50 to children with clauses that 25% of that should go to any grandchildren when they come of age. I know my mum wouldn't see any of her grandchildren favoured over one another, but I think she may not have thought through the process of the will.

My grandma (mom’s mom) helps me cover half of it thank the lord cause without her I would not be in college.

What happened is for parents weekend all my friends parents and mine came down for the weekend. I already thought it was kinda weird because my parents only came down for the game even though they always have a free place to stay at my aunts house. All the other parents came down early did their thing, but after the game while driving back to campus my dad talked about how I was unable to pay or go to college anymore and my step-mom talked about how I should take a semester off to work. They hadn’t spent a dime on my college all year, and I hadn’t asked for any money either. My dad was shocked when I proved he hadn’t sent me a dime in over a year. However he brought up that he didn’t want to sell the big ass mansion he was remodeling or anything. A few weeks ago he had agreed to cosign on a loan for two grand so I could pay for the semester and build some credit up to start getting my own. He despite previously agreeing left me high and dry on the money which I needed soon, so I told him to fuck off. I also told him if I needed to pay for college there’s other people or ways for me to do it. When I brought up the military he looked like a ghost despite always talking about the veterans.

This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

My (M24) girlfriend (F22) is good friends with a co-worker (M26). I obviously have no issue with that. However, I feel that they are too close at times. For example, my girlfriend and him get physically affectionate with each other than my GF does with any of her other male friends. Things like long hugs, hand squeezes, and the occasional head kiss. However, my GF assured me that there is nothing romantic or sexual going on.

Anyways, the two of them are going on a work trip together and opted to share a hotel room to save $. I told my GF that I am not comfortable with this, especially when she and I have not shared a hotel room at all. We have not slept together, even in a literal sense, either; as we both want to wait till marriage. She got angry, saying that they are not sharing a bed, just a room, and that ""I have no right to control her"".

In the middle of dates, parties, at home, every hour or two would just disappear for 10 or more minutes.

I get people have different bathroom habits but this is ridiculous, no one can possibly need to go this much. I think he’s trying to get out of interactions, and so I confronted him about it and he basically just told me to drop it and stop fussing.

I persisted because it’s annoying being in the middle of something and every time “I gotta go to the bathroom”. I at least want a reason, but he won’t give me any and is just kept telling me to drop it. After my third attempt to get something out of him he blew up at me and told me to “mind my business and stop nagging him”.

"ejkpt4","1578081272","AITA for getting a freshly-promoted coworker demoted after he slightly damaged some dude’s property?","Sorry this is kind of long. So I’m a newish HVAC apprentice. Admittedly, I’m not really good at it yet, but I’m learning. I get sent out with the installation crew to install sometimes, and sometimes I get sent out with service techs to troubleshoot/repair. Yesterday I went with a tech I’ll call “K.” K is really good at what he does, minus customer service. He simply hates interacting with clients and fears hostile interactions.

K and I went to some dude’s house to replace a fan motor. He did it while I watched and occasionally screwed/unscrewed some parts. He rarely talks to me so I didn’t really learn anything from it. While climbing up to the unit to grab his tools when we were finished, he stood on some nearby piping to reach his stuff instead of using his ladder because we “already put it away”. I don’t know exactly what happened, but something broke or something loose disconnected, because water started coming out out of one of the pipes and lightly flooding the area. K said “Shit. Well fuck. Don’t tell anyone. Look at this place, he’s rich anyway, he can afford it.” along with some other words I forgot, but that was the gist of it. I told him he really needs to tell the guy, and he told me “no”.

I called my direct supervisor and told him what happened while K was in his van looking at his next job’s info, and my supervisor called K to ask him to wait there, ***he has a part to bring him.*** K was pretty chill about it. Probably thought it was just a part delivery and then we’d leave, but my supervisor went over to our work area and then asked K why there was water everywhere. K said the water was “already there”, and my supervisor told him to go back to base without me. K left and my supervisor asked me exactly what happened, and I demonstrated, then he talked to the homeowner about everything while I waited in his vehicle. I’m not sure what was said or done about it as of right now.

Today though I learned that K was demoted from his new promotion. He had just earned a bigger salary and a bigger vehicle to make things easier for him. Today I saw him moving back into his old small vehicle. I assume he figured out that it was my fault he was caught, because he called me a jackass and my supervisor told me all the other techs don’t want me riding with them anymore. According to our warehouse guy, I’m more of an asshole because “his wife’s pregnant and has needed the payraise.” The dude literally wanted me to hide that he damaged someone else’s property because “he looks rich.” Am I really the bigger asshole here? I honestly can’t tell anymore.

**Added Context:** Our company is rated #1 in customer service in our area. Our company is very proud of that fact.

**Mini-Update:** Supervisor pulled me aside before we closed up the office for the weekend. Told me he talked to all the techs, asked why ***everyone*** coincidentally didn’t want me around anymore at the same time, and then explained to all the techs that I had absolutely nothing to do with it. A few of the techs have apologized for “listening to a rumor about me,” and are fine with me riding with them again, except for K. Just a little update.","1578093615.0","Not the A-hole","12","42"

My parents had a extremely fucked up marriage, they got married for the wrong reasons, tried to salvage it by having me and ended up hating each other's guts for the next 15 years. They tried to keep me away from that side of their marriage but they failed and I witnessed a lot of it. I'm not going to sit here and pretend it didn't affect me because it did. 

They got divorced when I was 16 but they still shit talked each other constantly. Once I got into college I slowly distanced myself from them. Couple of years later they meet new people and start to realize that maybe, they shouldn't have put me through that mess and try to fix it. I still keep my distance.

My father is currently married and has a child with his new wife. The kid is 5 years old and my father has been trying to get me to meet them ever since his wife got pregnant. I keep saying to him that I have no interest in being part of his or my mother's present life. I'm fine with having them call me but anything beyond that I don't really much care for. 

When I mentioned this to the people around me they said it was a dick move because since I keep contact with my father there's no way the kid is not going to question who I am one day.

"ejkqiy","1578081358","AITA for leaving a 10% tip at a restaurant?","I live in North America where it is customary to tip 15-20% for all services, like being served at a restaurant.

Earlier today, I went to a restaurant to pick up a sandwich on my lunch break. They offer online ordering, delivery, takeout, and in-house service.

Last time I got lunch there, I ordered a takeout sandwich which is listed on the menu as coming with coleslaw and a pickle on the side. When I arrived to pick up my order, only the sandwich was in the bag. I politely asked them about the two sides, which they said “only come with the meal if you dine in.”

I was annoyed, since I didn’t have time to dine in on my lunch break AND was paying the same amount for less food, but I paid and left with just my sandwich. It has been several months and I figured if I went in and requested the meal with the sides to go, they might try to accommodate me.

So today, I went in and requested to have the sandwich and sides as a takeout order. She told me they would not do that and I would have to dine in if I wanted the sides. My coworker came with me for the walk, and would also have to sit and wait, even though she wasn't getting anything. I reluctantly agreed to sit down, placed my order, ate both the sides and a few bites of the sandwich quickly, then asked for the check and a to-go box.

I (and many others in my area) never tip on a takeout order, and I considered not tipping at all since I was basically forced to eat there to get my money’s worth. I wasn’t going to tip anything, but I ended up feeling guilty and leaving a $1 tip (10% of the bill). AITA for tipping such a low amount? WIBTA if I had not tipped anything at all?

"ejkrn2","1578081488","AITA for not wanting to talk to friend I cut off?","Almost 4 years ago I moved to a new city and started hanging out with an acquaintance of who'm I had some mutual friends with from school. Over the next year and a half we ended up becoming close friends including taking some trips together including traveling to each of our hometowns to meet each others friends and family. During this time I felt like I'd found a lifelong friend; someone who'd be in my wedding and would maybe even be a godparent to my children. I helped this guy's brother find work in my industry and my dad helped him network and even took him out to lunch one on one a few times. However around the two year mark that I had moved things started to change. This guy had made a lot of new friends through a private social club he had joined and I had become close with some of my coworkers and had had some more old friends move to the same area as me. This guy started bailing on me right before we would plan to meet up usually due to his new friends inviting him to things. He openly admitted to me that he was embarrassed to introduce me to his new crowd because he thought they would not approve of me (he and them all work in finance and I work in the trades so he feels like I am too blue collar for his circle). I tried to brush this off and still made an effort to spend time with him but he continued to put down my profession and the neighborhood I lived in and would only text me first if he wanted something. The final straw was when he booked a vacation the same time as me and to the same place, and told me it was just to prove a point that he had the money to book this on the spot while I had had to buy my plane tickets in advance when they were cheaper. This was a vacation I had been planning and looking forward to for months and I wasn't going to let anyone ruin it so I decided to cut contact with him. This wasn't really a big deal or drama, I told a couple of other friends what had happened and we only have a couple of mutual friends so it didn't seem like an issue to me.

We haven't spoken for several months however recently it was my birthday and then his and we got in touch to wish each other happy birthday. Since that time he reached out again about wanting to hang out but I can't forget some of the things he has said to me. In addition to the other stuff he is very socially awkward and in the past has made women uncomfortable so I feel reservations anyway about keeping his company. 

I feel like my reasoning behind not speaking to him anymore is valid but a couple of people have guilted me about him, saying that he's socially awkward and can't help the way he speaks to me and that I should give him a chance if he wants to reconnect. I don't think he's an awful person or anything but he has said a lot of rude things to me in the past and I feel like it's my right to want to move on with my life. AITA?

At the time my connection with my friends were really tight but I was starting to really question if my ""friends"" actually cared about me. Everyone around me stared becoming really toxic towards each other. The gossiping and backstabbing got so bad within my friend group that I ended up hating myself for even being associated with them. Around junior year I started attending my new highschool. Being alone and in a new highschool, I started to become extremely depressed.It didn't help that none of my friends invited me to anything or involved me in any text group chats after I moved to the new school. I seriously hated myself and everyone around me. My friends would constantly pick on me and others just because it was ""funny"". I was so fed up with their attitudes so I started to fully ignore them and ditch them last minute whenever they actually decided to involve me in their plans. They caught on that i was intentionally ignoring them and full on started to become extra hostile towards me.
examples: "" Hey OP stop being a bitch, you're being so rude by ignoring us...""
""OP wtf?? why didn't you answer me to our plans you're being such a dick..""

One of the new roommates that I was going to be living with actually came with me to the shelter and helped me pick the puppy out. She offered to dogsit for me since I have a really busy schedule and so our dogs could play.

I had to go work in my lab for 8 hours so I gave my dog with my friend to dogsit. Being a young puppy and only having her for a couple days, she was most definitely not potty trained, but I was in the process of crate training her. I made sure to drop off her crate and gave the roommate very clear instructions on how to make sure the dog didn’t have an accident. She offered to do it for free but I felt really bad imposing on her like that so I gave her $50 to watch her for 8 hours, which I thought was a fair price. 

When I come back she tells me my dog had 7 accidents. I asked if she crated her and she said she felt bad putting her in a tiny crate so she just let her walk around. She then says, “I am mad though because we just steam cleaned the apartment and now your dog had a bunch of accidents so you need to pay to have the apartment steam cleaned before you move in.” 

I offered to just spot clean her poop and pee spots and I took home all the rugs my dog peed on (she mostly peed on the rugs) and personally washed them, but the roommate is sticking hard to me steam cleaning the entire apartment, including our bedroom.

For a long while my wife and I have been interested in buying a hybrid electric vehicle and finally did. We decided to transfer ownership of our other 2 cars to our kids. Our red car is from 2008 and our green car is from 2015. Though both kids can drive either car, Adam seems to always drive the red car and Lily always preferred the green one, so we decided to give Adam the red car and Lily the green car for this reason, but also because Lily takes better care of the car then our son, actually filling up the gas tank, covering it with a hood so it doesn't get too icy in the winter and she's never been in an accident of her own doing (she was rear ended last year but I can't hold that against her). Adam has been in 3 accidents and one of the cars in an accident a few years ago was a write off. The red car also has a slight, permanent smell of weed -  I don't think Adam ever smoked in the car but his clothes let off the scent. Since Lily is also more helpful at home and around the house than Adam, and drives it more than him, we felt she deserved the newer car.

When we told our kids about all this, Adam was very upset. He claimed as the older sibling he should have dibs on the newer car and, if anything, we should help him buy a newer car of his own. Lily thanked us for the offer of the car but that she didn't want to drive the red car because she couldn't stand the faint smell of weed.

Passed ONE MONTH, and I was so mad, I just knocked on her door and said ""Hey, could you PLEASE give my money? I am needing!"" and then she started to yell with me ""CALM DOWN, JUST PASSED SOME DAYS!!"" and I was sick and tired about that, but she was still my best friend ""Stop screaming, I just need my money, is that too much difficult to you?""

I have two best friends. When it was their birthday I stayed up late baking cupcakes for us to share. I got them gifts I thought they'd really like. I made them birthday cards with a little money in them. Today was my birthday. I don't usually expect people to make a big deal out of my birthday, and I don't really like to be the center of attention anyways. So because of this I don't usually do anything to celebrate. I guess I figured that this year might be different because I turned 16 and thats supposed to be a big deal or whatever so I was kind of excited. I was kind of dropping hints beforehand and talking about it to remind them like, ""Oh, for once my birthday is on a Friday so I can stay up late and go out"" stuff like that.

But they didn't even say anything. No one said anything. I didn't expect them to make a huge deal or get me a present  or anything like that.

We’re currently expecting our first child in May, and we’re both ecstatic. He’s always been extremely caring, and has only gotten even more diligent about caring for me since my pregnancy. I know he means well, but honestly, he does a bit much sometimes. He doesn’t want me lifting *anything* over 5lbs max, going up stairs “too fast”, or laying on my stomach, just to name a few. Most of the time I don’t mind, but there’s one thing he does that’s really started to get on my nerves: He’ll force me to eat. I’ll be honest, I’ve had a very easy pregnancy so far. No morning sickness, I’m not high risk, and I’ve been receiving prenatal care and both baby and I are always right on track according to my OBGYN. My only two “complaints” so to speak are a bit of lower back pain (I’m 22 weeks if that matters at all), and I have appetite problems. For some reason, sometimes I just feel like I’m stuffed, even if I haven’t eaten since the day before. I can go 2-3 days feeling this way, then eat the entire house and half of my husband on the fourth day, and then go back to feeling stuffed for days. Even when I don’t eat, I take my prenatals, drink lots of water, and have a protein shake so I’m still getting nutrients. My fiancé gets very upset by this, and even when I say I’m not hungry, he’ll buy or make me food anyway, and badger me until I eat at least half of it. I end up being incredibly uncomfortable and sort of in pain, but he still insists I finish at least half my plate. I’ve tried to refuse, but if I do, then he won’t eat, either, until I do. He’s a big man (6’6” 220+lbs) and works 12 hour manual labor shifts - He *needs* to eat, and the only way I can convince him is if I eat with him. WIBTA if I just started letting him go hungry? 

Side note: I have no history of any eating disorders, and this has only started since getting pregnant, and late into my pregnancy at that. I think maybe it’s the baby and my uterus taking up a lot of extra “space” in my abdomen, but that’s just my theory - I know next to nothing about babies.

ETA: I should also probably mention that my fiancé is an only child, because his mother lost many babies before and prior to having him. One baby in particular was lost because she was homeless at the time, and wasn’t getting enough food to support the pregnancy. Another baby, she lost when arguing with his father and she threw one of those huge boom box radios at him. So please don’t think he’s just controlling for no reason— he’s just sort of afraid of pregnancy because of what his mom went through. Also, I’ve not brought this issue up to my OB. I just figured since baby and I are healthy, and always on track at appointments, it must not be a big deal.","1578084294.0","Not enough info","6","23"
"ejla2y","1578083595","AITA for not paying my mother's bills after buying her a house to live in?","I will try to keep this as short as possible. Throwaway because I didn't want this on my main.

 Anyway. My mother's long term partner (they weren't married but they had been together for around 10 years) passed away around April 2019. They both paid bills etc. It was my mother, her boyfriend, and a friend of the boyfriend. Once Boyfriend died, my sister moved in with them. She got together with the friend. My sister is a piece of work. She's a drug addict. Sister is also abusive (yelling, screaming, threatens my mother, etc). My mother would call me almost daily begging for me to do something.  

 

The best I could do was to buy a cheap house across the street from me. We did not buy it outright. There is a small mortgage on it. She knew this and she knew how much it would cost for her to stay there. She moved in in August. Now let me tell you, this has been the biggest mistake of my life for multiple reasons. The current reason: she keeps hinting at me helping pay her bills.  

 

Now, first of all, I'm not even working. I just finished school. I'm PRN at my job so I work very little. I won't go through all of our money problems, but my SO and I are struggling a little bit because he had to switch jobs, dogs got sick, etc. None of this is relevant to the house we bought since she pays MOST of the mortgage; we still pay taxes and insurance. 

 

So here is my dilemma: AITA for refusing to pay for her bills?? She says she can't afford it and I see no other options for her. The mortgage is CHEAP. If it were legitimately rented it would be hundreds more per month. We do not have the money to help her. And even if we did, we have put thousands into the house and her, and we don't feel we should have to pay even more money EVERY SINGLE MONTH to her because of her poor choices in life.  

Two quick notes: she is on a fixed income and does not work. and 2: she cannot live with me and my SO. We tried that for a weekend before the Boyfriend even died. It was hell. She doesn't care enough about other people to not smoke inside of my house. My SO has breathing problems, and I'm mildly allergic. Then she lies about it. Her dogs are obnoxious (2 of them). They do not listen to anyone, including her. They bolt out the door any chance they get. AND they do not have their current shots or anything.  

 

&#x200B;

tl:dr: My mother is hinting for me and my SO to pay her bills after we bought a house for her to live in. Her sister helps her with money every month and that is the arrangement that they have had for YEARS.  We don't even have extra money and once I start working I still don't think we should have to pay even more for her life after all we have done.","False","Not the A-hole","4","27"
"ejlan1","1578083660","AITA: Is my family the asshole for refusing to talk to relatives that took us to court 20 years ago? (Reposting for clarity)","I wanted to get other people’s opinions on this matter, since my whole family thinks we’re right. 

My dads family is huge. My grandparents had 11 kids, one if which died when he was a teenager, so this pretty much involves the other 10 when they were adults. 2 of the sisters decided to take the rest of the family to court after my grandparents died. Here’s what happened:

My family owns a fairly large cash crop farm that was started by my great, great grandparents back in the 1800s. As my grandparents were getting older and they got put into nursing homes,they pretty much depleted their life savings and really didn’t have much left in their name. Everything was either already given to the kids or under ownership of the farm. When they died, their will had everyone get an even portion of what was left of their life savings. But a bunch of antique tractors at the farm were forgotten about and seemed to not be owned by anyone. 

The two sisters thought that since these tractors were forgotten, other stuff that they owned was also forgotten. They thought that everyone’s house and the land it sat on was also owned by the farm. And they thought my grandparents had millions of dollars that was being left out and that they were entitled to this money. Money that didn’t even exist. 

They took our whole family to court and demanded we give them the rest of what they’re entitled to. But it ended up coming down to the antiques that were forgotten. Since everything else they thought the farm/my grandparents owned (the houses and land) turned out to already be under someone else’s ownership. So they had to write down a list of all the antiques, take it to find out the value of each one, and divide the value of them 10 ways, with the sisters obviously getting 1/10th of the value. 

As a result, nobody has really talked to them for about 20 years. And they haven’t talked to us. But the last few years, one of them has been trying to talk to us and put herself back in the family. She sends birthday cards, Christmas cards, graduations cards, etc, and most recently, she came to my cousins funeral and tried talking to us as if we had been talking the whole time. One of them even sent a card to my aunt saying something like “we didn’t know [cousins name] very well because you guys don’t talk to us”. They’ve never apologized for what they did, we were treated like shit during and around the time of the case, and nobody wants to even try being friendly with her anymore.

Anyway, Eric and Maya just got a place, and they invited me over for dinner. Before I came, Eric texted me that Maya was cooking a curry (I don’t remember the dish name), and how spicy I wanted it. I reminded him that Indian food generally doesn’t agree with me, but Maya had already started prepping the ingredients. Basically, Eric told me I’d better eat it and be happy about it, or he’d never hear the end of it from Maya.

The day came, I ate the food, and I promptly felt a rumble in my guts. I ran to the bathroom and basically painted the toilet bowl. It was like 20 degrees, but I had to open the bathroom window for ventilation. It was bad. 

I excused myself to go home after that, and Maya asked if I was okay. I told her I was fine, but that Indian food often gave me diarrhea. She basically said that I was being racist, and that by eating dinner with the mindset that I’d get diarrhea, I’d tricked my body into rejecting the food.

He said he understands why I'm upset and  that I am justified in feeling the way I do. From now on no decisions will be made by either of us pertaining his family without serious conversation. He is also going to let his mother know she crossed a line that should not have been crossed. The lack of communication between him and I will hopefully get better from here on out.



So its past Christmas and we have been on a super tight budget. We canceled our trip to my husbands family's house for this past christmas because of it. About a week before christmas his mother asked if we were getting all 5 of his nieces and nephews presents.  He asked me and I said no, we dont have extra income for that. We participated in the secret santa between us and his siblings and also got his parents gifts. Well he never said anything to his mother but told me that we were going to get them stuff. This is where my bitterness kicks in and I'm unsure if I'm being petty or rational.  I'm expected to pick out and wrap presents for his whole family every year. I'm not a huge fan of them because they think we are rich and expect us to travel 8 hours, get a hotel, buy them all (9 ppl) presents, and take them out to eat and buy food for the house for dinner and lunches even though we dont eat there. If I want to see my family I have to travel alone with my 3yr old and often ask for them to help pay for the trip. And my father lives 45 min from his family and he throws a fit when we have to go visit him because my dad is mormon and boring. Any who... I woke up this morning to a message from my MIL asking if we were buying the 5 kids christmas presents.. I just said no because it's far after Christmas and our paychecks havent been what they were in the past.  I didnt call my husband to confirm. Part of me feels bad because he didnt get to go see them or anything but the other part of me thinks oh well, I got bitched at for spending 70 dollars on groceries for a week why the hell would I go buy them presents weeks after christmas?? Am I being a dick? Clearly I'm bitter but even so, I feel justified in my actions. Money isnt just going to appear because they think we are loaded.

I ask if theres seafood in it because I will have a bad reaction and he assures me there is none. I try a little and soon after I am breaking out in hives. I run to the bathroom and vomit and I tell my dad to pay and go home immediately so I can take benadryl or some other medication.

It's gotten more and more extreme but they've always laughed it off and even if one of them has got annoyed they've always shook hands after calming down. Things finally went too far today though. 

Ella is a double amputee. She lost both legs when she was little due to a birth defect. She's never let it get her down though. She has the best prosthetics available, works out regularly and does really well at school. She'll be off to uni to study economics in september if she gets the grades, which I'm sure she will. She's also very pretty and has a boyfriend who adores her. 

I was making breakfast for her when I heard a scream from upstairs. I ran up into Ella's room and found her crying because her prosthetics were gone. This woke up Rosie, who upon seeing Ella sobbing admitted that she went into Ella's room overnight and took them and left them in the attic. To be fair she regretted it as soon as she saw how upset Ella was. She tried to hug her and say sorry but Ella screamed at her to stay away, and she went to get the prosthetics straight away. 

Ella was so upset and felt helpless. She does have spares but they're stored away. She can walk on her stumps but it's extremely difficult and if she falls over she can't get back up. Rosie gave them back but Ella told us both to go away and cried in her room for hours.

Her fiancé (32 M) is horrible. He never offers to help with anything, is lazy, dirty, overeats and boozes constantly, talks bad about our family, quick to criticize and pick fights, and is all-around selfish. No one in my family likes him very much, including the bride's parents. 

I have two reasons I do not want to attend:

1. The Salty/Slightly Selfish One: I was supposed to be a bridesmaid, then was kicked out because her fiancé couldn't find enough people to be in his wedding party. He has like three guys compared to my cousin's nine bridesmaids, so I was let go. *(This is not the main reason, but I was upset that her fiancé demanded she cut people from her wedding party because he didn't have enough, so it made me resent him more).*
2. **The Serious One:** The fiancé is always belittling my cousin about everything-her clothes, her weight, her interests, her friends, her family, her diet, her favorite games, EVERYTHING. He's always bullying her, telling people not to ask her things because ""she doesn't know anything"". He never leaves her alone.  

Their wedding is a few months away. I do not want to attend because I do not want to watch my cousin throw away her life away for this asshole who doesn't deserve her and criticizes her on end. A few people have tried to reason with her and told her she could do better, but my sweet cousin is always apologizing for his behavior and said: ""I know he can be mean, but he needs me and I need him"". 

I told my uncle (her dad) that I was planning to not attend the wedding. My uncle was upset and told me that if my cousin is happy, that is all that matters.

My mom just said to give it back to him, but after arguing for a little bit over if i should give it to him or not i just asked him if he wants to fly it and he just says no, we started arguing again over if he actually wants to fly it or not as she kept saying he doesnt know what he wants which is kinda true but i can tell when thats the case (which is another thing that annoys me when she acts as if she knows what other people are thinking/feeling). After putting it away i come back get the controller and as i do that i ask him again to make sure if he really doesn't want the drone to which he replies no, after he says that i look over to my mom and she just tells my in an annoyed voice to go away.

I was dating a guy who had a son and would constantly tell me how hard it was being a single parent and trying to study to become a firefighter etc. Backstory: I was/am a single parent. My child's father was never in her life or provided any type of support. (Guy I was dating knew this.) I had her before I was 18 and the struggle was real. This guy though co parents with his child's mother. She is remarried to a great guy who treats their son as his own and also supports him. They share custody and overall costs for their son with the mother/stepfather doing 70% of the supporting and the guy I was dating carrying 30%. Where I want to know if I was the asshole is because after him constantly telling me how I can't understand how hard it is for him being a single parent..... how stressed out he is.... and just being overall condescending and whining about his struggle, I told him he was NOT in fact a single parent. A single parent in my opinion is a person raising their child solely on their own without a partner helping financially or with overall childcare needs. He did not take it well and I got tired of the negativity and broke it off with him. Now I am being asked out by another man who is hash tagging #singledad life and when I ask him if he has sole custody etc, the answer is he co parents with the mother and they share custody. So reddit was I the asshole for telling the guy I was dating he wasn't technically a single parent? I'd like to know in case this guy has the same thoughts about single parenting.

Edit: The majority have spoken and IATA. There were other red flags when I was dating him and I let his belittling and whining get the best of me and became a gatekeeper on single parenthood. I am still cordial with him and will be contacting him to apologize for what I said. I don't like bad kharma or hurting others. Thank you Reddit!","1578088309.0","Asshole","45","59"

One neighbor, however, seemed to have been making a lot of comments abut everything. He made a few complaints about the food, about the music, etc. And that’s fine, it’s new to him and I don’t expect them to love everything.

"ejm1ai","1578086754","AITA for getting angry that I have to look after my 2 year old niece?","I’m stuck in my family’s country of origin because of a few setbacks with immigration in the country I actually live in (I lost the identification that lets me back into the country and am waiting for a replacement).

When I first got here, I met my niece for the first time. She’s lovely. She’s also wild, like 2 year olds tend to be. My plan was to stay for two weeks (Christmas and New Years) so I figured I could deal with her 2 year old antics until I left. No harm, no foul. 

But then I realized I wouldn’t be able to leave when I intended to and it dawned on me that my sister might be mistaking me for a live in babysitter for the time being. 

I don’t mind looking after my niece — especially not if it’s when my sister needs to get things done . I understand that she’s just a 2 year old who happens to get into mischief. What I don’t like is that my sister will leave me with her while she goes out to smoke joints with her neighborhood friends, talk to her baby daddy on the phone for hours, or when my niece is having a tantrum she doesn’t want to deal with. 

 Today we got into a fight because my niece dropped an entire box of juice on the floor while she ate a snack. I went to tell my sister and my sister told me that she would clean it up once my niece finished her snack. I asked to clean it up immediately. She said no, that if her daughter wanted to make a mess then that was her right as long as she (my sister) cleaned up after her. 

That really pissed me off because she’d told me the exact same thing over breakfast (that she’d clean up once my nice was done) when my niece squeezed out a bunch of ketchup on the table and threw half a plate of egg on the floor, and again over lunch. Both times I’d been the one to clean up. 

It definitely seems petty to be angry for having to clean up after a 2 year old but I’d literally been the only one to do any cleaning in the morning after a particularly messy night before. What pissed me off even more was knowing that she was out side, locked in the car, FaceTiming her bf. 

I then asked out younger sister if she was made to act as a live in babysitter over the summer she spent here and she said yes, which pretty much told me everything I needed to know about how I’d be spending my next month or so. 

In the fight that we had I told my sister that I didn’t want to be considered a babysitter for when she wanted to go out and do “fun” things while I’m stuck at home and that if that was the way she would be acting then I’d be spending as little time in the house as possible. 

Our dad overheard the fight and although he isn’t saying anything I know he thinks that I suddenly don’t love my niece enough to look after her whenever it’s needed (which isn’t true. The problem is I’ve been looking after her when it’s NOT needed).

"ejm1vf","1578086820","AITA for not allowing my dad to stay with me until he takes steps towards sobriety?","A little backstory. My dad is an alcoholic, although he had a period of sobriety while I was in high school and college. His slide back into drinking occurred once I graduated college and lived in another state, and although it was heartbreaking, it was something that since I lived pretty far away was not something that affected my day to day life. Fast forward to now; I moved back to the same state (although I live a couple hours away) and am married with two children. Occasionally, my dad and step mom will ask if they can spend the night if they are in the area for a job that stretches over two days.

A few weeks ago, we went to my dad's house to celebrate our family Christmas. My dad left to get a few pizzas for lunch and when he returned, it was obvious to me and my step mom that he had been drinking while out. The way in which I can tell he has been drinking isn't really slurring or falling, but just the change in his demeanor and personality. One of the things he was doing was harassing my husband, asking for constant hugs (sounds harmless, but my husband isn't really touchy feely with people other than me and our kids and this is well known) to the point everyone was uncomfortable.

When we got home, my husband brought up my dad's behavior and I told him I thought he was drinking while he was out getting pizza (my husband thought the same thing based on previous experiences) and after discussing it agreed that it would be best if he did not spend the night until he has taken some steps towards his sobriety. Our thinking is protecting our kids from any behavior that comes along with his drinking. I am in no way going to keep my kids from seeing my dad, but I want to do it in a situation where I could leave if I felt uncomfortable.

"ejm2d8","1578086883","WIBTA for going to my parent's vow renewal/anniversary?","My parent's anniversary is on Valentine's day. On the 10 and 20 year anniversaries they've gone on holiday, and on the 5th and 15th anniversaries they've thrown a huge party. They renew their vows and then recreate their reception, so everyone has to dress up for a formal sit down dinner, then speeches, they cut the cake, and the tables get pushed aside for dancing. It usually starts around 6 and people start to leave around 10.

My girlfriend and I got together on 13th February last year. Because everything happens on Valentine's day, we agreed to celebrate then, and we've booked some stuff and put down a small amount of money, mainly in deposits (we had to pay to book slots in a class we're taking together and we had to pay to book a table at a local restaurant). The class starts at 7 and the reservation is at 9.

I got my years mixed up, and forgot that this Valentine's day was my parent's 25th anniversary as for some reason I had it in my head that this was their 23rd.

My mum called me today, and halfway through the call she told me a party invite was in the mail and I was like ""uh, what party?"". She then realised I forgot that it was their 25th and they were doing their renewal/reception, and reminded me. I admitted that I made plans with my girlfriend, and mum said I could bring her along. I said I wasn't sure. Mum did the ""I'm not angry, just disappointed"" thing.

Right now we can get our deposits back and I'm sure my girlfriend wouldn't mind if I explained it, but this is 3 firsts at once for me, as it's my first:

1. long term relationship
2. Valentine's day with a girlfriend
3. one year anniversary, 

so I don't want to admit that I screwed up our plans. I'm 1 of 5 kids, and the other 4 will all be there, and I could swing by my parent's place earlier that day and see them. My girlfriend is really looking forward to this and I don't want to screw it up. The class we're taking isn't running on the 13th and the restaurant doesn't have any open reservations on the 13th. I called a couple of other restaurants but everyone seems to be getting around the Valentine's day rush by going the day before.

She was due 10 days before me, she was pregnant with twins and I was pregnant with a singleton. We didn't talk about baby names at all, neither of us were telling anyone the names until birth because my FIL has a habit of complaining about them constantly and saying how they will never get anywhere with that name, we are making their life harder, etc. I figured if he didn't know until birth and they were already named that would curb some of it, I'm guessing that was her thought too but I really don't know, and anyways its not important. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately she had complications with her twins (TTTS) and had a still birth at 24 weeks. They had named the babies on certificates and one of the names was the name my husband and I chose for our daughter.  I had a pretty uneventful pregnancy and gave birth last week on the 26th. We decided to use the name for a few reasons: it was out top pick and we couldn't agree on anything else, as well as, its not an uncommon name, plenty of people have the name or use it for their children.

We used to go with my parents for those because they’re close by and it was a tradition.

He’s not too bad anymore, it used to be really bad. As long as he’s mentally prepared he doesn’t get triggered by loud sounds anymore, I.e watching movies is fine now. Fireworks seem to be the exception to this, at least viewing them.

My mother hasn’t been appreciative of this. Every time we missed an event I got a barrage of texts how he’s probably just faking it to keep me from seeing her. I’ve told her off multiple times but try and keep peace because my dad is great.

But this New Years she crossed a line. Since we weren’t going to the fireworks, she said she wanted to come to our house so we could still celebrate. At around 10 when no fireworks had started yet so my husband wasn’t prepared, we were all sitting in the living room(except my mom), and she comes running out of the kitchen banging a metal spoon on a pot as hard as she could.

This of course triggered my husband. I won’t get into it but he was pretty rattled. I kicked her and my dad out and told her not to call or text.

I would say I'm more career oriented as opposed to my wife who always puts family first. I've been the sole provider for a few years while she went to school for her masters and even now as her maternity leave is finishing up. We live pretty comfortably with my income. 

I am also in  a very niche field and the money can dry up any day and we've been very fortunate that things have been looking up.  I currently make about 140k a year and my wife would be making 50k a year. If I stopped working, i don't have the skills do do anything else so I would go back to working minimum wage jobs until I figure out what I want to do after. 

We have a mortgage that we're paying down, we eventually want a house, and then also saving for our son's future as well as any other kid's along the way.

Our daycare situation is simple, the grand parents both live in the city so we've been alternating between them. We don't have any day care costs besides activites that the grand parents want to do so her not working to save day care costs isn't an argumenet. 

The way I see it is, if we're both working now we can continue to work hard and make the money we need in order to buy a house, save for retirement and even potentially retire earlier. And if anything does happen my wife still has her job and I can find a minimum wage job so we can get by.

My wife wants to spend time with our son and watch him grow but I tell her eventually he'll be in school and she'll be out of her career for a while which would make it hard for her to get a job. She even did 2 years for her master's which I wouldn't want her to waste.

He only will go to the bathroom inside the house. She has not made any real effort to train him in either of these aspects.

My roommate brought up possibly putting him in doggy day care while she isn’t home and is at work/school, saying it wouldn’t be that big of an expense. This was before we had him long and realized that the previous owners had lied about him being kennel and potty trained. While she isn’t home he barks for hours, for basically the entire time she is gone (and she knows this). I can hear him barking as I drive up to the complex after being away at work or wherever I’m at. I’ve tried letting him out and watching him while she isn’t home but he constantly is going to the bathroom around the house (he will NOT go to the bathroom outside) or getting into things (as puppies do) and needs to be watched 24/7, which I do not have the time to do and is why I haven’t gotten a pet even though I would love to have one.

I work early mornings, and usually get off work some time around/after 9am. Afterwords, I usually like to take a nap before I do things with my day. I have insomnia so getting and staying asleep is always an issue, and since I’ve been back from visiting family for the holidays I haven’t been able to sleep after work because he is constantly barking all day while she is gone.

We can be kind of loud and boisterous. I was talking for a few minutes, and to illustrate my point, I walked up to the TV and pointed to the screen.

"ejmink","1578088802","AITA for missing the anniversary of my dad’s death?","Background: 
I’m in my early 30s. My dad died 4 years ago, just after midnight on NYE. It was very sudden (cancer). I live abroad and rushed home to be with my family. I stayed for a month and have come home to be with them every year since.

2 of the 3 years since then, my mother has decided last minute to visit family friends who live several hours away. One year she left before my partner flew in from spending Christmas with her family abroad, leaving us alone in her house on NYE as neither of our flights could be changed.

This year, we confirmed that she wouldn’t plan any last minute travel. We tried to make plans for NYE, but she wouldn’t get back to us. This is an ongoing issue as she often makes/changes plans last minute without taking us into consideration, but that’s another topic.

30 December:
My mother and sister say, “Wow I didn’t realize NYE is tomorrow,” and we say we are happy to just stay in together. They say that’s boring and that they are going out drinking. We say we aren’t up for getting wasted, and my mother says that we should just stay home or go to a friend’s house then. We were already supposed to visit some friends the next day, so we change our plans to go later and stay over. Everyone is fine with this plan, including my mother. 

1st January: 
2am: We send them a Happy NY text. They decided to stay in after all, which was a bit frustrating as we could have all been together, but no big deal.

10:30am: We have breakfast with our friends. They are planning to strip wallpaper in their 5-month-old baby’s room as they have just moved in, and we offer to help them.

12:30pm: We text my mother and sister to update them and see if they are awake and if we should be back at a certain time. No response. 

1:30pm: We call my mother to ask if she wants us home by a certain time. She says they might eat at 3 or 4pm but there are no specific plans and we should come back “whenever.”

2pm: We say to eat without us and that we will text them when we are on our way back. No response.

4pm: We text saying we are on the road and asking if we can pick up anything. No response. 

5pm: We arrive home. They’re both shut in their bedrooms. I go to see what they are doing, and they say they’re going out (and don’t invite us to join). I offer to drive them. They decline and come back drunk hours later. 

The confrontation:
They have barely spoken to us since. When we left for the airport, my mother refused to hug me goodbye. I said “I’m sorry for whatever I have done to upset you, but I don’t want to leave it like this,” and she blew up at me. 

Basically, they think it should have been “obvious” to get back ASAP on the anniversary of his death. They said I cared more about stripping wallpaper than being with them. That’s definitely not true, and I don’t want to hurt them. I feel like I communicated clearly with them but maybe I missed the obvious?

I’m (21F) currently a senior at a university that is about a 2 hours plane ride away from where I live. The college is pretty famous for having great athletics and my dad is a huge collegiate athletics fan (played football in college etc) so he often wants to fly out and see games. He has a lot of money, so he is able to book flights out to see me very last minute and that’s what he often does - he will sometimes tell me the day before that he is coming to visit me and wants to spend time with me. The past 3 years I didn’t mind, but he visited with more frequency this year and I really wanted to my last football season as a student. Because he visited I didn’t pregame or go out to bars after with my friends because I don’t like being drunk around him and he wanted to spend time with me. He came out to visit me on four separate weekends this semester, and this is more than any of my other friends’ parents visit them (their parents come out once a semester). My dad also calls me on the phone pretty often (like more than 3 times a week) and will talk about nonsense. I ended up feeling resentful that he visited so often and called so often because I felt it took away from my final football season experience. 

Fast forward to today: I am home on winter break. When it got brought up that he visited me a lot last semester and I said “yeah you did” and then went on to say that it prevented me from doing what I wanted with my friends. I voiced that it annoyed me when he announced his visits last minute because it causes me to rearrange my plans for the weekend to accommodate him. I also brought up when he decided to come see me and bring my siblings during a weekend where my friend from home (who had never visited me at school before and likely won’t be able to again) was visiting. My friend had had the trip planned for months and he decided to come literally 3 days before. He said he would let me and my friend do our own thing, but he ended up sitting on my couch with my siblings the whole day. He got very mad at me when I said all this, called me “ungrateful asshole” and told me to “fly back tomorrow”. I don’t think he actually wants me to leave tomorrow, but still. 

I think he visits me because he enjoys the sports but also because my teen sisters at home are giving him grief. He doesn’t demand that I spend the whole weekend with him, but it often ends up that way. 

So what do you think? AITA for telling me dad he visits me too much at college?

He wants me to get an estimate before deciding to go through insurance as they have a 1,000 deductible apparently. I oblige and get the estimate. It’s over 800 dollars. I send it to them. 

His mom (my aunt) is upset that we want this fixed and questioning whether her son did all the scratches. And I think she just wants us to not fix it since it’s minimal damage. Talking about how I need to put family first and how I was 18 once and other nonsense. We want it fixed since it’s our first new car and never had any damage to it at all. Aita for wanting it fixed? They will be paying out of pocket (the 18 year old works and makes good money and lives at home). The parents are not in a great financial situation. I offered to get another estimate or even work out a payment plan. Salty asses said they will just send me a check and be done with it.

"ejmng9","1578089358","AITA for not wanting my roommate to bring 10 friends around for a party?","TL;DR 10 is too many people for a small apartment. I said yes, but now want to say no.

My roommate asked me yesterday if he could bring a few friends around for drinks before they go out for the night. I said yes before thinking to ask how many people there would be. He said around 10 and I said yes again but now I’m having second thoughts.

We been sharing a small 2 bedroom apartment for a couple of months but never discussed having parties at our place in advance of living together. My roommate has only been in the country for a couple of months and wants to make new friends.

He’s been going out with these people every Friday for the last month. In his home country this was normal for him. Randoms he met in a Facebook meetup group. They’re young (20-26) and they party hard. Up until now they have been gathering at someone else’s house but I think they’re getting tired and don’t want to carry the burden of hosting every night. He is for the most part a good room mate. Very agreeable which makes me think if one of the others wanted to do something stupid in the house he would not have the assertiveness to say no.

I’m worried about my place, my stuff and myself as these are essentially strangers. I sleep pretty early because of an early work shift (8pm bed to start work at 5 am) so if they are partying around 9pm I could try and sleep through the noise and trust them to be sensible or I could stay awake, break my sleeping schedule to make sure nothing is broken/stolen and set boundaries where I need to. Neither of these seem like good options.

I feel bad reversing after I said yes and about getting in the way of him making friends/having fun. But I don’t want to commit to an ongoing event that’s going to make every Friday miserable indefinitely.

"ejmozd","1578089535","WIBTA if I asked my fiancé not to include his friends in our wedding party?","My boyfriend (23M) proposed a few weeks ago, and we're starting to dip into plans for our wedding. Something that's come up pretty quickly is the question of who's going to be in our wedding party. We each have a sibling – my older sister (27 F) and his older brother (27 M) – and we're planning for them to be our Maid of Honor and Best Man. We also have a shared close friend and previous college roommate who's going to be officiating. 

The problem, however, is that my fiancé has always had a wider social circle than me. He has a lot of friends, some of whom he's been close with for a long time (since high school), while I honestly have pretty much zero close girlfriends. I have a number of acquaintances, but no one I'd feel comfortable asking to be a bridesmaid. Personally, I'd be thrilled to have a small wedding party with just our siblings, but he's planning on asking seven friends to be his groomsmen. 

I've always been insecure about my inability to maintain close friendships (I have a fair bit of social anxiety, besides just being rather awkward), and I really don't want to be reminded of it on my wedding day, when I have no bridesmaids standing behind me and he has a whole bunch of guys on his side of the aisle. I also just think it would be obviously uncomfortable, embarrassing, and (this is less of a concern, but still) unbalanced from an aesthetic perspective. 

WIBTA if I asked him not to include his friends? I'd be fine with them being given other roles in the wedding (ushers, etc.), but I really don't want him to have a ton of groomsmen. That said, I know it's his day too, and I don't want him to feel obligated to be unhappy for my sake.","False","No A-holes here","26","41"

About 6-7 mo into our relationship, he bought purchased a 1 bed/1ba loft. Then, about 1.5 yrs into our relationship, we decided we were ready to live together.

Since I was renting at the time, it made sense to move into his place. I pay him a monthly rent which includes HOA fees and utilities. I'm also helping him pay for home owner's insurance. Overall, I feel comfortable paying this monthly amount. When it comes to shared costs like rent, groceries..etc, we have a 60/40 split due to income difference (he pays 60, I pay 40).

Recently, there has been a couple of plumbing issues that have come up. The kitchen sink was leaking and my boyfriend was assuming that I would be sharing the cost with him. I have a different perspective and this is where I'm wondering if ITA.

Since he purchased the property with his own money, I don't think I should be held responsible if the property's plumbing is defective. I told him that as his girlfriend, if he needed me to assist financially, I'd be happy to pitch in and help, but that as someone who's renting this space, I shouldn't be expected to be financially responsible for the replacement of a kitchen faucet/water line.

His reaction to this was defensive and it seemed clear that he thought it made sense for me to help pay for it. I reassured him that it has nothing to do with us or him, but simply I don't feel financially responsible. This was all yesterday and he hasn't brought it up today. He ended up paying for the plumbing job with his own money.

That being said, since he hasn't said anything today about it, it leaves me feeling unsure.  I will most likely bring it back up, but wanted to reach out for an unbiased opinion. What do you think Reddit, AITA?","False","No A-holes here","17","70"

I've known her for 12 years and she's always hated kids and talked shit about babies. I personally don't mind that she's like this, although it is annoying when she goes on rants about how ugly people's babies are, and I've known her to call toddlers assholes. 

I know this sounds unbelievable, trust me, I feel like I'm not in real life. She texted all of our friends last week to say that she's having a very important dinner and she needs everyone to come. This is 15+ people. In a smaller group chat, she told me and three other girls that she is 'expecting a new arrival' and she wants to announce it at the party. We were all super shocked, but very happy for her. She was very evasive with questions, but I honestly just assumed she was feeling weird about being pregnant/admitting she had decided to have a child after all, and I brushed it off. 

So, we all get to this dinner party at a local restaurant. She stands up to make a speech, saying (as well as I can remember), ""I'm really excited to announce that we are expecting not one... But three new arrivals !"" Everyone was shook! Until she handed out the ultrasounds, and they looked nothing like babies. We all looked at her confused, when she said ""Princess (her cat) has been a naughty little girl, and is blessing us with three little ones. I'm sure you're all super excited to meet the babies, and there will be a naming party when they're here!"" I think the last part was a joke, but needless to say, most of us were quite pissed she did this. 

Two of the women there have been very vocal about having fertility issues. I am also pregnant, and so are two other girls there. I feel like this whole thing was set up to belittle the fact that most of the people in the group (ranging from my age to mid thirties) are settling down and having kids. One of the women with fertility issues actually left upset soon after, and the other one just after her. I called a cab after I'd eaten my meal, and left early. I immediately blocked her on everything, because I'm sick of her being so anti-kid, especially when she was addressing multiple people who are pregnant and struggling to conceive. I sent a message in the smaller group chat saying that what she did was insensitive and disgusting, and she responded saying it was a joke and I should lighten up, and I obviously don't know her very well considering she has been vocal about not wanting to meet my baby.

My brother, who I am the legal guardian of, is newly 18 and he wants tattoos. I know from personal experience that it's better to go to a decent place and get something done by a professional who has trained for this, and I also know he has a friend who owns an at home tattoo kit, so I said that because I want him to be saving up right now I would cover the cost of his tattoo, so long as he went to the studio I got mind done at, which he agreed to as it's a good studio that does great work.

I asked what he wanted and told him that when he hits 18 he can get a consult and just let me know the cost. He's turned 18 a few days ago, come back with a sketch of barbed wire, and it's a neck tattoo.

I laughed and said ""alright, where's it really going?"" He says he's serious, it's going on his neck. He says he wants something that'll look cool, that he can see whenever he looks in the mirror, and it's somewhere prominent and he tells me that he doesn't want a tattoo just to cover it up.

I say that I hope he can afford that, because no way am I paying for him to get a neck tattoo and definitely not one of barbed wire of all things.

He feels that I'm being unfair, that I offered to get him a tattoo in the first place, and that I can't just take back my birthday gift, especially since he's 18.

I feel that a neck tattoo that looks like barbed wire is stupid and that there are going to be situations where he will need to cover it. At 26, I have tattoos from when I was 18-20 that I regret but they were small and are either covered up or easily hidden, they weren't barbed wire around my neck. I told a friend about it and she said it's his mistake to make, I already offered, and reminded me about the friend with the at home tattoo kit from eBay and how little I want my brother using that guy as his tattooist.

Background;

I’m 14 and live in the UK. I will state that I am nearly one of the youngest in my year group but I have autism.

Actual story:

I can go on about the things my sister has done but I will state a small section before moving to the real topic. So, my nephew came along and I gave up my room to share with my sister (now I have a smaller room downstairs), became a mini maid by nearly doing everything only to get called rude names by my sister.

Now my nephew I love him with all my heart but.. he has stolen my spotlight. Like I said before I’m in year 10 and I’m working my butt off to at least gain an award. I understand the he’s young (2 years old) but I’ve never really had my spotlight as my parents worked, which I understand, and my sister went to school and hung out with friends. But I thinks it’s ridiculous that I don’t even have one photo of me alone anywhere in the house because of my nephew..

I just hate how my sister got told to at least let me have my time to shine or have quality time with them (mom and dad) but our plans keep getting cancelled due to Him. Reddit be honest.

AITA?

Edit: I know this is fast but I know there isn’t enough info. So basically my nephew has taken nearly each and every family member away from me and is some times really rough to play with. I even get in trouble when I’m telling him off for doing something wrong..

Edit 2: so I won’t expect you to take back your opinions cause yes I understand that I am an AH for being jealous of a 2 year old.. but Idk what to do because, my sister dumped her son on my mum and dad (who haven’t put their foot down to her) which causes them to push me out of the picture.. Also thank you for being honest.. I deserve it..

Last edit: thank you all for telling me your personal stories and more.. I understand how immature I am. I’ll work harder to make the relationship between my nephew and I will be strong.

I asked him about it and he said the letters get turned around, which pretty clearly is dyslexia but he refuses to get tested or see a therapist or something for it.

It’s pretty annoying sometimes when we’re trying to get somewhere or order dinner and he takes forever to read the menu. Sometimes if he’s reading out loud I’ll just read it for him to speed it along.

Today we went out to lunch at Panera and we were second in line. There was a little sign that said something along the lines of “credit card machine broken, cash and gift cards only”

It took him nearly a solid minute to read this. I’ve talked to dyslexic people before and none of them are this bad. He had to pronounce-out loud- every word. About 3/4 of the way through I said “take your time” because we were about to have to pay. He got really upset and left without me. So I get lunch and head back to work, and when I get home I called him and he ripped into me about how disrespectful it was.

However, by stay I thought she meant “visit,” especially with Thanksgiving and all the December holidays occurring at the time of the request. Also, the contracts we signed stated who were the occupants that would live here, which was the two of us. 

Fast forward to now, past the New Year, I asked her how much longer her husband would be visiting. She clarified that he was staying, until the lease is up, and I asked if she knew that her contract was for one person, and that I myself was looking for one roommate, not two. 

She asked if it was a problem, and I mentioned it wasn’t, but for formality’s sake, he would need to sign a contract himself. She said she emailed the landlord and let him know (I had no previous knowledge of this) but he never responded to her. 

Now she thinks I want her out but that is not at all what I intended. However if she intended to move in with her husband it would have been nice to know this information prior to her moving.

During summer I received a jealous fb SS of me meeting my gf's children (12,16,18).  Daughter was upset and wanted to be included in the ""fun stuff"" like mini golf, go karts, batting cages. The stuff you do to help keep kids comfortable while meeting for the first time. So I extended an open invite. Just come by. School was starting soon. There wasn't much left of summer.

September was her birthday. She was busy. I asked for suggestions for a gift but was told I could buy her a gift card so ""I can buy a bunch of sh*t"".

For the past few years when they come home, the visit is typically like this: the first week I try to talk and they criticize me, then I stay quiet and avoid talking to them for the rest of their visit. I know I was sensitive about it when I was younger and they visited, but I truly feel like I've grown into a young adult and that I should be treated like a younger brother who’s not a child anymore. 

My other brother is home for the week. We recently watched a movie, and he asked me if I had seen it before. I did see it, so I said yes. My brother then goes ”No you haven't” and I lost it. I yelled at him about how he's treated me like a baby for the past few years, and brought up several events where he blatantly accused me of lying when I've said I've read a book or a movie.

My sister (16F) has always been a little bit of a brat, she thinks she's better than everyone else, smarter, and always right. My mother has always shown favourtism to her. My parents are divorced and dad isn't in the picture.



My sister is prone to tantrums and always wants everything her way. And cries for the dumbest of reasons.



I take care of the puppy myself, and buy everything she needs. I've taught her basic commands already as she's very smart and a well behaved little girl, this is my first dog ever, she stays in my room and sleeps with me. And she has made me so happy in just a matter of weeks. I don't allow my sister near her.


My mother works for emergency services and on her night shifts I am in charge of looking after my sister, even though she's 16, my mother forces me to babysit her.


Fast forward to last night, my sister comes in my room without permission and my puppy runs up to her and she starts trying to play with my puppy, even though I've told her never to do that. My puppy gently bites her leg because my sister is running around playing with her, and my sister starts crying, literal tears and calls my mom at work, and tells her my dog bit her. 

My puppy is 8 weeks old and she never bites hard, she play bites, it's like a nibble and it doesn't hurt, my sister didn't even have a mark on her at all, my sister is known to be dramatic and this is the last straw for me.


My mom comes home this morning, and tells me that she is going to get rid of my puppy if it keeps hurting my sister. I told my mom that I'm done with my sister, and will be disowning her and moving out at the end of the year.


INFO : My sister has a history of crying about anything and everything she possibly can, and painting me in a bad light to our mom, I was diagnosed with severe depression at 14, mostly due to how different my sister and I get treated, she gets treated like she is made out of gold and I get treated like trash. Which is why I decided to get an emotional support animal. My sister loves attention. She fakes having depression, because she sees that my depression has gotten me some attention from our mom and can't handle not getting 100% of the attention. I say she fakes it because recently she told me she's just doing it as a trend and says that if I can fake it, so can she. I am diagnosed by a psychologist so I find it funny that she says I am the one faking. I am always blamed for upsetting my sister even when it's not my fault, I get the blame for whatever is going on with her, if she throws a tantrum then my mom automatically yells at me, assuming that I did something even when I haven't spoken to my sister in days sometimes.

I said, you didn't ask. They said, ""it goes both ways, you know!"" And I was like, I know, which is why after the third time in a row I asked and you didn't seem interested, I stopped.  

I then did this with another friend, where I asked three times about one day in particular. They had agreed to make a dinner plan for a particular date, but not a time or place. I had already asked three times, so when that day actually came, they didn't ask about it or initiate it.

The next morning, they confronted me about the day before, and said something like ""Had a great time last night! (sarcastically obv)

After two times of this happening I started to rethink this strategy. Maybe if it had happened once I would feel justified, but the fact that it caused a fight twice led me to believe that I was in the wrong.

What do you think of this AITA? Is this unreasonable?

I (25f) am an actress, and I recently booked a lead role at a substantially sized theatre in the city where my husband (30m) and I live. I have been struggling to get gigs, and so when we found this out we were both elated. He has always supported my dreams of becoming an actress, and due to the nature of his job I have been lucky enough to pursue this dream without us worrying about finances. He is the love of my life and I am so lucky to have him.

Two years ago, my best friend took his life. He was a stage manager, and we always talked about how we would move to New York and work on the same shows together. We had been friends since college, and we were each others favorite people. My husband and I met shortly after college, so they have known each other for some time and we've always all gotten along.-Side note, my best friend was gay, so there was never any kind of romantic jealousy-When he passed away, my husband was there for me every step of the way, and has been my rock through all of this.

When the time came to write a bio for the show (what shows I've been in before, college, etc.) I decided to dedicate my performance to my late best friend. I didn't even think about telling my husband, because I thought he knew how much it meant to me, and that it didn't change anything about our relationship.

However, on opening night, my husband was incredibly angry. He said that he was thrown off, and since I'm the lead, that it was embarrassing that there was another mans name in the first bio of the program. A bunch of our friends came to the show, and he said that it was embarrassing that he wasn't mentioned, after all he had done for me. I tried to explain to him about what my friend and I used to talk about all the time, but he wouldn't listen, saying he was too hurt to talk about it.

AITA? I didn't realize this would be a big deal, but from his side I can see how he would feel slighted for not being mentioned.

"ejnokv","1578093852","AITA for asking friends to dogsit?","My boyfriend and I (35M) live with a dog Roxy (20 lbs. and an energetic 11 years old) that I adopted from a shelter eight years ago. Roxy is generally well-behaved and gets along with people and other dogs. Her one quirk is that she hates smooth floors indoors. Whenever we travel, we usually make an effort to take her with us or ask a roommate to feed and walk her, which has never been a problem.

Four times we’ve requested dogsitting from friends. Twice were housesitting situations where the friend stayed at our house, and both times passed without issue.

But two instances have given me pause about whether we should ask friends to dogsit at all:

Once, we left for a weekend, and a couple with two dogs of their own offered to watch Roxy. Afterward, I emailed them to treat them to dinner, but they never responded and there was no further followup. We now hang out regularly, but they never offered to dogsit again and decline when we ask.

Recently, a coworker Sarah met Roxy and, unprompted, offered to dogsit if we needed. So when we decided not to take Roxy to visit family for the holidays, I asked if Sarah would be interested in watching her even though it would be a 9-day trip. She was eager and planned to take Roxy to her parents’ house for a few days for Christmas. The first day, Sarah texted that Roxy peed on her bed. Later, she texted that Roxy kept peeing and pooping on her parents’ rug, so Roxy wasn’t allowed there anymore. Sarah spent the rest of the week with Roxy at her apartment. My guess is that Roxy wouldn’t leave the rug because of her floor phobia. Of course, I felt terrible and apologized profusely. After I returned, I gifted Sarah a bottle of wine, and she insisted that she loves Roxy.

No one has directly accused us of being assholes, and my boyfriend thinks I shouldn’t worry about it. I just can’t shake the feeling that these friends resent us for taking advantage of their offers. I am aware that paying to board our dog is an option but have always pursued alternatives first. I always thought of dogsitting as akin to rides to the airport — a big favor, sure, but not so big that asking friends to do it for free is a huge faux pas. Am I wrong?","False","Asshole","4","16"

My parents wanted me to get Confirmed, and practically forced me to say that I would go along with it. A month later I emailed the priest and talked about not wanting to get Confirmed, and the priest agreed that I did not have to get confirmed and took me off the program. My parents found out later and got so unbelievablely mad that they said they said I would not get my permit for a very long time

Fast forward 5 months later to now, where I still have no permit and my mom is saying I won't get it to around March. We have only talked about when Ill get my permit once, and it did not end well. She thinks I have not earned her trust back from emailing the priest (which I have apologized for two days after it happened). She says I'm being entitled and impatient. I believe she is holding a grudge for too long and is being very controlling to punish me. I'm thinking about talking about it with her and saying that this has gone too far, and that she needs to stop being so stubborn. My dad and Grandma have sided with me on the issua, but say I shouldn't try to argue with her.

He’s always had anger issues and doesn’t know how to control his feelings. He’s just an asshole. He left my mom and I when I was really young and I saw him on and off until I was 14. He was an ass, abusive, the full fucking nine yards. We’ve always had a very strained relationship because he constantly lied to me about my mother, my stepmother and step sister, and made me question a lot of things. He’s also been a heavy drinker and smoker since he was a teenager, which also put strain on our relationship. We’re talking half a case of beers a day and packs by the week. He made fun of me for the way I looked, calling me a horse (as a 10 y.o girl) and just didn’t respect me. I eventually caught on to his bullshit and started seeing through the lies. 

When I confronted him a few years ago he didn’t even have the balls to admit the truth when I caught him in the lies. He separated me from my stepsister and my stepmother and step grandparents after he divorced my stepmother and I have recently reconnected with them through letters. I found out that they still love me and consider me as one of their own, which was really difficult as my father cited me as the reason why his second marriage failed. 

I’ve been on and off NC with him for the last few years now, and have seen him once in person. He looked awful back then, he’s 60 and he looks like he’s 80 (sunken facial features, thin frame, grey hair, etc.) He now lives near his brother and his family. They kicked him out because he hurt a family member, was hiding beers in the basement (after my family told him again and again that in order to stay with them he needed to stop) and cussed out my older cousins. He doesn’t learn from his mistakes as this has happened multiple times.

Cue the present: dad posts on Facebook about his cancer in very broken English, as per usual. (He’s not American-born but is a citizen.) I saw that post and brushed it off as another lie, he does that shit on social media all the time and I don’t take his word for it unless he tells me or my family members tell me. He called me today asking to tell me some personal information, and when I saw that message I burst out laughing. I called him and proceeded to tell me he has “type 2 cancer”. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think he deserves to go out this way. I don’t think he deserves to get cancer, even with everything he has put everyone that cares about him in his life through.

My niece is at my parent’s house and tells my mom that she has a friend who’s mom owns a bunch of stores around the area and wants a big fancy wedding, but hasn’t been able to find a venue.

My mom starts texting with this person to talk about her wedding. This lady tells her to come down to her store the next day so they can talk in person and she offers my mom a store discount.

So my mom ends up going to meet this lady at her store with my niece, but the lady makes up a bunch of excuses as to why she can’t meet them then. My mom ends up buying a pair of shoes at the store and leaving. The lady texts my mom later apologizing for not meeting her and asks if she got her discount. My mom said she didn’t, but it was ok. The lady ends up setting up a tour of the venue. 

My dad picks up my niece to babysit on the same day as the tour (convenient right?). He stops to open the gate and my niece points to something on the ground. My dad goes and picks it up, it’s an envelope with $20 and a note apologizing for mom not getting her discount.

So the time for the tour rolls around and the lady wastes about an hour of our time making up excuses about running late. The lady finally arrives, but says she is walking from the gate, instead of parking in the lot. My niece then says that she sees people walking this way from the gate (~1/4 mile away). I have been outside the entire time and no one has pulled up to that gate and there is definitely no one walking. We look around for her and my husband does a perimeter drive in the golf cart, but no one sees anyone. The lady texts and says that she is about to pass out from the heat of waiting outside for us, so she leaves. 

The pieces all start to come together that my niece made up a fake person, got a fake number, texted back and forth with my mom and myself for hours talking about a fake wedding, made up that envelope of money and threw it out the car window, pretended that she saw these people arrive for the tour, and lied to our faces. 

My dad takes my niece home and says that he is going to talk to her parents when he gets there. He doesn’t end up talking to them since my sister wasn’t there, but then he also doesn’t call/text her or put any effort into telling her.

Thanks! 





I work in a specialized department at my company with a slightly small group of people.  

Usually some of us grab coffee together in the mornings.  Now we are all paid very well to begin with, but under certain circumstances, some of us are given a bonus (20%) for a day or multiple days at a time.  

Generally, the guys getting the bonus will pay for the other guys breakfast (5-7 dollars).  I've paid for breakfast multiple times for one person, we'll call him Phil, wether I'm getting the daily bonus or not as sometimes it's easier.  Say the waitress forgets to split the check, I'll just take it and pay for Phil instead of asking her to redo it. Phil does not do this.  He will make the waitress redo the check. 

Phil, although he regularly gets the bonus, has never offered to pay.  I'm found out from other people in the department, that Phil is known for always accepting the free breakfast, but never reciprocating.  One time I paid on my way out, and he didn't even feel inclined to leave a tip.  Luckily the other person I paid for, took care of it.   

Personally, I don't care.  I buy for someone to be nice, and usually decline if people try to purchase for me, but he's never even thanked me for buying. 

Recently we were out, and all the guys getting the daily bonus asked for combined checks.  Then it got to us, and Phil asked for individual checks.   I interrupted and said ""No, one check is fine, I don't want him to struggle paying the mortgage this month.""

Now, most people in the department loved my response, but I'm hearing a few guys think it was rude.  I think it was perfectly acceptable. So what say you reddit, AITA?



Edited for Info

1. It is absolutely not a money issue.  

2. He's done this his entire career. 

3. You don't understand the context of it, but people who received the bonus, usually pay for the other guy for a reason.  They are not required to, but it's considered polite to do so.

4. My bigger issue is the Never saying thank you, and going out of his way to split the check when it's possible he'll have to pay. 

5. I did stop buying for him, but this particular situation made me want to, just out of spite.","1578225923.0","Asshole","152","77"

So we have lived in our apartment for 4 years now, and have had the same neighbors for the last 3. We get on fine (I thought), one of the things we've bonded on are our love for cats. We both have the same cat tree - this is important! We've talked about having the same tree. They keep theirs on the shared porch for their outdoor cats and we keep ours in the house.

We recently got a dog, and he destroyed their cat tree when he got past the baby gate we had set up. I was real sorry and told the neighbors I'd ""re-imburse them"" (exact quote) and went and bought the same cat tree. I texted them when I brought it home so I could give it to them.

Well now they're pissed and demanding  money I ""said I'd give them"" when I said I'd ""re-imburse"" them. I don't see their problem, I replaced their cat tree with the exact same one within a day of the tree being destroyed. They talked to my girlfriend, who agrees that they're being ridiculous but thinks we should return the tree and give them the money to keep the peace. I'm thinking they can do it themselves if they really think they deserve the money instead of the tree. I still have the receipt.

I have both my BA and Master's in US History so I was excited that my son finally got to take the same classes that I loved. I tried to build a relationship with Ms. Lipston, but she was pretty cold. Fine. Not all teachers want to see or deal with any parents. I get it.

Before the break, I got a call from the school nurse that my son was ill. He had a high fever and needed to go home. I picked him up and as a courtesy, I emailed his teachers letting them know he was ill and going home. I was shocked when Ms. Lipston emailed me and said that my son was not sick. She said that his fever was from his drinking hot soup (yes, the have a vending machine that serves hot broth) and then going to the nurse knowing that the thermometer reading would be high, thus he gets to go home for the day, right before the 2 week Xmas break.

Now, my son is no dumbass, but if this were true then I got to give props to my son for thinking of something so genius and give props to Ms. Lipston for knowing what's up. I took my son to urgent care and they examined him. They said he was coming down with the flu. He wasn't faking anything. And then he got really sick with pneumonia and needed to go back to urgent care for medication.

I replied back to Ms. Lipston a week later (a week into the break) that as it turns out, he really was sick. I made a joke that I hope she didn't get it. She wrote back that she never said that he wasn't sick. I reread the email she sent...yes she did. So I wrote back to get more information about this thing with my son drinking hot soup and made it clear that I wasn't upset, but was curious. I would have been fine if she admitted she made a mistake or even a joke about it. I am not some psycho dad. I just wanted to make sure SHE knew my son wasn't faking it. She replied that she never specifically said that my son was being manipulative.

That did piss me off because she is the teacher who lectures students about integrity and owning up to your mistakes and she is doing the opposite. I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy, so I posted her original email and her responses to me on FB. I didn't give her name, but some parents figured it out. I guess it got back to her because the principal asked to schedule a meeting with me.

EDIT: For everyone saying that I should have taken up the issue with the teacher. That is EXACTLY what I was trying to do. I wasn't being a dick, abrasive, defensive, mean or angry. And actually I couldn't have cared less about her making a mistake. My biggest issue is that she often incorporates themes of ethics and integrity into the lessons plans which I appreciate so it bothered me greatly that she thinks my son is a liar or dishonest. I was trying to either correct her that my son wasn't lying and/or get more information as to this whole soup situation.

&#x200B;

As a parent, it concerns me yet not something worth the time (at least in my opinion) to file a complaint. I know the principal is every parent's best friend and the teachers have mixed feelings about him. If I brought this to his attention, I have no doubts it would have caused her some trouble which is what I did NOT want to do. Anyways, this was more of a communication issue between me and the teacher and less of a classroom problem.

&#x200B;

I wanted to know if I was crazy one which is why I posted it on FB without her name. People made their comments. I assumed another parent figured out who the teacher was and tipped her off about the post. She's furious about it. Someone said she's doing ""damage control.""

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Here's my clapback to the Reddit teachers calling me the asshole. I hope you can find the humor in my being told to find something else better to do when you're probably posting in the classroom.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: Saying you're a teacher doesn't make your argument any more valid.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: People who are saying that she might be a bitch to my son to get back at me are wrong. She's already a bitch to everyone.

&#x200B;

EDIT 5: I got another email for the principal because he wants to meet first thing on Monday, before my son goes to her class. I asked him what was the purpose of the meeting and he said there was no meeting - more like a ""mediation"" - it had to do with something I posted on FB and she is apparently ""distraught."" I asked if she was ""distraught"" over her calling my son a liar or the post and he said we'll discuss Monday. He wants to meet with me first, then all three and then a meeting with her. He asked me to take the post down until we meet. As a courtesy, I will take it down pending the ""mediation.""

&#x200B;

EDIT: So I had this mediation with the principal and explained my intentions. He agreed with me more than what he needed to. Then Ms. Lipston came in and was all over the map. She didn't do herself any favors. She kept on trying to ""one-up"" me over the posting of her emails. For example, she said I ""leaked"" them LOL. I told her that I respected that she had some fire in her belly for someone with such a cold personality, but unless she was going to admit that she was wrong and apologized then I'm reposting those emails. 

Principal intervened and chewed her out. She turned as bright as a tomato. Then he excused her. He asked me NOT to repost because it would be harder to reprimand her ""officially"" later on as he wanted to make it more administrative than personal. 

At the end of the day, she posted a notice on her class website that she was going to be out all week LOL.","1578342294.0","Everyone Sucks","2324","1128"
"ejos3l","1578098590","WIBTA For Telling My Best Friend She Can't Move In With My Boyfriend And I?","So, a little back story, my boyfriend of 3 years and myself recently got news from his parents that they were planning on moving and that we could rent the house. It's very affordable for the both of us, especially at 19, so obviously we're both stoked. It's perfect for us. A small 3 bedroom house within our price range (cheaper than the 2 bedroom apartments we were looking at). Now, the problem is my best friend. I told her about me moving in with him (as of right now, he lives in a different state currently in the house with his parents. I'm gonna move in this summer). She also lives in a different state, considering I moved out of the state right before I met my boyfriend, and talks about me moving in with her. Ever since we became best friends, we've talked about living together in the future. Obviously as we got older and I met my boyfriend, things changed. When I told her I was moving in with him, she basically invited herself to move in with us, saying we can all be roommates. I didn't say yes or no, I said we'd think about it. Normally, I'd be fine with that. She is my best friend after all. But after thinking about it, my boyfriend and I decided not to let her move in with us. I know, I know. I sound like a jerk, but here's why. I love her and everything, but there's a few problems that I have with it. She always smokes (weed, cigarettes, vapes) and drinks. I have no problem with it, but that's where all her money goes to. She can never pay for her phone bill or her car or anything because she spends her money on those things. She's also always going job to job. Meaning she gets a job then gets fired immediately for being late, usually because she's hungover or reasons like that. So she can never keep a job for more than a week, it seems. She asks me for money for those reasons too. I get it, shit happens, but how can I be sure that she'll pay her part of rent if she can't keep jobs or spends her money on her habits? The last thing (also the most stupid reason, probably) is because if something she'd said. She would talk about me sharing my boyfriend with her (threesomes), or just doing stuff with me. That was a big no no for me. I am not comfortable with that at all (call me what you want, but I don't care). He doesn't want that either. It may seem insignificant, but I don't feel comfortable with my best friend living with us after trying to hook up with me and my boyfriend, especially after her recently getting out of a relationship in which she was engaged and saying she's going to become a hoe. Would I be the asshole for telling her she can't move in with us?

I work in a call center in the US, you know the type. To break up the monotony of the daily struggles, we try to celebrate everyone's birthday. Management had been doing pretty good at remembering everyone's birthdays up until last summer.

There are 4 of on the team with summer and fall birthdays, myself included. All 4 of us were forgotten and there are only 12 on the team. We didn't say anything about it at the time because we were all swamped. The assumption was that we were no longer celebrating birthdays at work, although there was never any communication one way or the other. Then we get to today.

An email is sent to the team from our party planner, seeing who has suggestions on how to celebrate an upcoming birthday for one of our coworkers. Birthday celebrations came out of our own pockets, usually we would pool together money and get a cake, decorations, and maybe some flowers. The most recent one we had this last spring was a bit bigger, it was food for the team in addition to the cake, decorations, etc. 

I'm curious why we had an 8 month gap where we skipped people, so I emailed back. I asked if we were starting up birthday celebrations again, because some of us were missed. They stated they wanted to use the allowance that management has each month before they lose it, which is what they had done at the last celebration in the spring.

So because previously we had been doing this from our own pockets, I responded that I didn't feel it was fair to have the company fund birthday celebrations for some of us, while the rest don't even have their birthday acknowledged. That regardless of intentions, it looks like favoritism. 

Management came back and responded that they weren't excluding anyone, they just wanted to make sure the monthly allowance got used so it wouldn't go to waste. And that we had some months where we were too busy to use it.

I responded back that if we aren't able to be consistent with remembering everyone's birthdays, then the allowance shouldn't be used for that purpose. Use it to buy lunch for the team sure, just don't attach it to someone's birthday. 

At that point, management responded that we will no longer be using company money for birthday celebrations. They felt that there was ""too much complaining about a free lunch."" So now my coworkers are mad at me, saying I ruined the birthday celebration they were planning. The initial email didn't go to the person who has the birthday coming up because it was supposed to be a surprise, but at some point management included the entire team, so now it isn't a surprise. I was told afterwards that everyone was broke from Christmas and that they weren't able to donate much, so now it will be that much harder. I wasn't trying to ruin anyone's fun or increase stress, I just wanted to point out the company funded favoritism. AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","9","11"

I know I'm the idiot.","The car battery on my old beater wouldn't hold a charge anymore, and since money is tight right now I took it out myself and brought it into my local branch of the national auto parts chain with a name that sounds like a fine fellow from the old country.

The shop was slow when I went in, so I walked right up and a sales associate helps me while several other employees stand around behind the counter. I brought my old battery wrapped in plastic and carried it in a sturdy old reusable grocery bag. I exchange my old battery, receive the credit on the purchase of my new battery and pack it into the bag. It's a tight fit and the sales associate helps me get it in.

I get home and open it up, and there's fluid everywhere. Surprise! It's battery acid, and it's on my hand, jacket, pants, and passenger floor mat. I called the store and the sales associate who helped me answers the phone. ""Yes"", he says. ""That's definitely battery acid. I saw you walk out of the store caring the battery on it's side.""

I knew old car batteries could leak, but I thought it was a result of age and corrosion. Turns out, car batteries need to be kept upright at all times, and leaking acid is a normal feature of new car batteries too.

When I asked him why he let me put the battery in the bag sideways and walk out, he passed me to his manager. Turns out, his manager was one of the other employees standing around behind the counter when I was in. Yes, he also saw me pack the battery into the bag on it's side and walk out with it like that. ""Why didn't you say anything?"" I ask. ""Well, I thought you knew what you were doing."" He said. That was an hour ago.

I'm going to use their website and the details on my receipt to report the incident. After all, several employees and a manager witnessed me unintentionally do something unsafe with a product I had just purchased which directly caused me harm minutes later.

He texted that he was sorry again and he dropped my birthday present off at my house (he has a key because he sometimes looks after the place like getting the mail if we're on vacation) and it was in my fridge.

When I got home, I looked in the fridge and saw my favourite champagne! It's a reasonably small bottle and pretty expensive. I left it in the fridge to stay cold and decided to save it for tonight, but probably would split it with my mom after everyone left so I didn't need to share. 

I went to look in the fridge not long after everyone got here today to get some of the appetizers and wine to share out when I noticed the bottle was half empty. I immediately knew it had to be my brother because my parents would never do that to me and my brother is one of those people who will eat or drink anything in sight without any regard as to who it belongs to. 

I confronted him then because I was so pissed and he said ""yeah that was me, I didn't know it was yours."" I got even more pissed and loudly said ""Are you serious?

"ejoyvq","1578099455","AITA for asking someone to swap seats on a plane?","This happened a while ago, but after seeing many posts about plane seat swapping, I want to know if I was actually being an asshole in this situation.

So a few years back, I was taking a long flight, about 11 hours. My family were flying back with me, but since we are all teenagers/adults we usually split up to get cheaper seats. In this case, we had three single seats and two seats on a three person row (with a stranger in between).

So during this flight, I was really sick. I had flu and a sinus infection, but there was no way I could miss this flight, as this was our flight home from a vacation.

Because of this, I picked an aisle seat we had because I had to get up and down pretty frequently, but a few hours into the flight I was getting worse from the altitude. The person sitting between me and my sister was clearly not enjoying my disgusting self and this was a red eye flight so I was likely waking him up by moving and getting up a lot. 

So, a few hours into the flight after several under the breath comments from this person, I suggested he swap with my other sibling a few rows behind. He said that he paid more to be further up in the plane (which I'm not sure is true) and so he wouldn't move. I accepted this, and continued getting up frequently and such. 

However, after a while, he got up and brought a stewardess, who basically told me that I had been purposely disturbing the guy next to me, and she would find my parents if I continued (I'm not sure if this is relevant, but at the time I was 19ish, but I look very young so people have mistaken me for being 14/15).

Once the man sat back down, I kind of went off on him and said that if he was disturbed by me then he should've just taken the offer to swap, and since he didn't he will just have to suck it up. I think he was hoping the stewardess would upgrade him. He then said he'd be willing to swap now, and I basically told him no, since my brother was asleep and I didn't want to wake him by trying to swap over.

AITA for insisting we stay in a hotel room instead of with family?

Recently, my fiancé and I had to travel out of state to attend a funeral for my fiancé’s paternal grandma.

My fiancé’s brother and his family (pregnant wife, baby nephew) live about an hour away from his dad. The funeral took place near the dad’s home. 

We were already planning on renting a cart we would pick up from the airport. The airport was about 1 hour away from my fiancé’s brothers home (2 hours from the dads home). 

My fiancé wanted to stay with his brother and brothers family.  I wanted to stay in a hotel closer to the funeral for two main reasons: (1)  it seemed like an imposition upon the pregnant wife who is taking care of the baby; (2) the travel was going to be intense because we both needed to go to work the day we leave and the morning after we come back, and I didn’t want to add additional car time to that. A secondary reason was that, by the time we finally arrived at the brothers on the first night, it would be around 2PM- which seems annoying and bothersome.

My fiancé didn’t want to stay with his dad because he was mourning. Also, I think my fiancé had ambitions of staying up late drinking and hanging at his brothers. That’s what they used to do when they had visits before kids. 

The cost of the hotel was around $90/night for 3 nights- not a substantial burden for us.

So I gave my husband $149 cash in an envelope and asked him to handle the chimney sweeper so I could work in another room. I didn’t rush out to the bank to get exact cash or anything, I just happened to have it on hand.

After the guy left my husband was pretty upset with me and said he felt embarrassed by what I did. He said the guy gave him a look that said “seriously?!?” without actually saying those words when he took the money (a $100 bill, two $20 bills, and 9 $1 bills) and “smirked”. I wasn’t there so did not witness this myself. My husband said we looked like “cheapskates” for not just giving $150 or $160.

I’m confused. Am I supposed to tip a chimney sweep? I honestly didn’t know. I thought the price he quoted was the price I was supposed to pay? Also, if the worker wanted $150 or $160 for his work, why not charge that?

I am very shy and have social anxiety and generally don’t do well communicating with people I don’t know very well. I am also an extremely direct person and have trouble understanding when people beat around the bush and play what I call “social games.” Just say what you want. If you want $150 for your work, tell me that.  I find dealing with people, especially in service setting where you have to negotiate, exhausting. I am always unsure of myself.

My husband pointed that out how I don’t understand social cues, how I should have known that $149 was just what they say because it sounds better than $150 for marketing purposes. I should have known that I needed to give $150 and possibly even tip to not look cheap and avoid bad service. He was also pointing out how this translates to my professional life. I’ve had a hard time with job interviews and office politics in the past and don’t have any of my own friends or close family.

This really hurt my self esteem and really had me questioning myself/my judgement. I also feel bad if I am supposed to tip and didn’t.

AITA for giving the chimney sweep exactly the amount he quoted/billed? Should I have rounded up to $150 for etiquette purposes?

Edit: My husband said that the embarrassing/weird behavior was not the lack of tip (husband said he wasn't even sure if he would have tipped or not) it was giving $149 exactly, particularly 9 $1 bills that were a bit creased/crinkled (but still totally acceptable).  He said it just looked super cheap and weird.  I didn't have a $10 to give $150 even if I wanted to, I would have had to give $160 since I only had $20s.

One has made all of the other four of us her bridesmaids along with her cousin, her sister, and her college roommate. The other has a smaller party, but made everyone in the friend group except me a bridesmaid so that she could include one of her fiance's friends. Privately, she told me that it was a tough choice, but ultimately choose to not include me because I was ""the most reasonable"" and would understand the most and not stop talking to her over it. Which, in many ways she is right:  I love all of my friends a lot for their charm and bubbliness, but I am the most introverted friend and I am probably the least excitable. 

A few days ago she came to me and asked me to be an honorary bridesmaid instead. I have heard horror stories about these sorts of things and the way they start drama. I do not want that tension...

I would rather just be a guest at the wedding. It also just seems more like a consolation prize than anything else, and I have too much pride for that.

When I was younger I never really asked my parents for Christmas presents because I was very apathetic to the holiday. I never really cared if I got a gift or not but if either of my parents asked me what I wanted I had to think really hard and generally only asked for something small or simple. However, the year this incident occurred was when those cool LED cat headphones came out and I was mystified. I had never seen anything so cool before in my life and I really wanted them. so by the time Christmas was coming around I made my move and for the first time ever I asked my dad for a Christmas gift without him asking me first. 

I went into detail about them and even pulled up the specific ones I wanted and where they could be bought. I even said that I didn't care what color so the cheapest ones would work for me and this is the only thing I really wanted. Since the headphones came out that same year it was on the pricer side and around $180 to $250 (can't remember the exact price of them now) and I was expecting my dad to say no. to my surprise he said ok and that he would look into things. I was shocked. for the first time ever I was super excited for Christmas!

When the day finally came my brother and I opened our presents only for my joy to quickly turn into disappointment. I found myself with a clunky uncomfortable beige color headset that hurt my ears when I put them on. I was disappointed but I understood that the headset I wanted was rather expensive so this was fine until I heard what my father had to say. Since it had been years since this happen I can't remember exactly how we got onto the topic of why this headset but chances are I asked him if the other one was too expensive or if he forgot which ones I wanted when he told me how much this headphone cost.

OVER $300!!

That's when he started going over every little detail saying how this headset was superior and they were used by professionals in the music industry and all the little mechanics but I stopped listening. He ignored what I asked for and chose something that cost around $50 to $100 more than the pair I wanted. All I remember was a lingering sense of confusion and not knowing how to react.

Tonight, my current gf jokingly told me she's gonna start smoking. So naturally I said please don't, you might get lung cancer among other things. She then said ""well when I die young that's just tough. Not my problem"". I suddenly got very very upset and stopped talking to her for a bit.

Here’s some background: 

My friend recently got his car repossessed for being behind on car payments and in between jobs. He has been staying with me and my girlfriend for about two weeks. We told him that we could stay for one month while he’s trying to figure some things out. 

He randomly asked me if I was going to be working yesterday morning, I told him that I wasn’t. A couple of hours later I see him putting on a helmet and preparing to take my bike out.
I stopped him and asked him where he was going. He said he had a job interview. I asked him why he was taking my bike, and he said that it was close, and I didn’t need it for work so he was going to use it. 

I told him no, and he seemed really confused. He said “its just a bike, and I’m just going up the street, what’s the big deal?”
I told him that it was my vehicle. I use this bike to get everywhere, I don’t have a car. My bike costs $1000. He argued with me and said I wasn’t going anywhere and he would be back in an hour or so. 

I asked him why he couldn’t get a Lyft. He said that he couldn’t afford it. So I asked him how he would afford to get my bike replaced if something happened to it. I told him that he is obviously irresponsible and I don’t want him to take my bike. He accused me of throwing his situation in his face, and told me that the job interview was only a mile up the road. I told him to walk. He said that he wouldn’t make it on time because he planned on taking the bike. I told him no and locked my bike up and walked away. 

He ended up missing the interview. He has been bitching so some of our mutual friends about what happened and blaming me for him not getting a job. I have been told “bikes are meant to be shared” and that I should trust my fiends more so I’m an asshole for not letting him take the bike such a short distance. What do you guys think?

I’m 16 and work at a local Chinese restaurant that my parents used to own. I’ve been helping out there since I was 10 and when there was a change of ownership, my parents and I thought it would be a good idea to formally work there because I had a lot of experience in the restaurant and I know all of the customers for a better experience, the new ownership and all. On Christmas Eve night, we had a bunch of large orders totaling over 1.2k in total for deliveries. The manager was excited because these could determine the future success of the restaurant so we do our very best. The delivery woman, let’s call her Kim, does the orders fine and dandy but something is off when she doesn’t arrive after one hour. Everyone’s confused until she texts the manager that she got arrested for a traffic warrant since she didn’t pay for a ticket. The next day, she still doesn’t arrive. And again and again. On the 4th day, I’ve been doing quite well in the business under his management but he suddenly is empty handed when paying us. He says that he ain’t giving us any pay until we get the Kim to get the money back here. This is bs because I didn’t get her address and she isn’t responding to calls or messages. I’m pissed at this point because I’m paying for most of my meals and I’m saving up for a new laptop for myself. I demand the money because it’s not my fault that Kim isn’t coming back with the money.

"ejpvty","1578103653","WIBTA For giving an ultimatum on an order?","Hi Folks,

Around 1 year ago (I'm unsure on the excact date, but parts of the order exceed one year) I commissioned digital art from an artist I considered my friend. A year (and some more) on, only part of my order has been completed. Part of the order includes a 2018 Christmas piece, 2 pieces of a 6 part package, and possibly more (I don't have the list on hand at the moment.) 

While I wasn't given any approximate completion date from the work, and attempts at asking were met with accusations of rushing them and trying to skip the queue, I know that the artist has done many pieces commissioned after mine before my pieces. 

Trying to confront them in approx late summer 2019 (Admittedly, I brought up the fact that I had donated money to help with their financial situation at the time in the argument which probably wasn't the best idea) brought up the accusations I was being abusive, trying to abuse our friendship, ect. At this I backed down, and due to my mindset at the time I avoided them for a while. They came to the point that because I was 'Abusive' they'd refund the work - however never did so. 

I've now messaged them since and had no acknowledgement of the previous work - no refund like they said, no product, nothing. I'm now also unfortunately out of the refund period I believe, plus some orders were completed in part so it wouldn't be fair to refund the full payment even if I could, but with approx $150 of my money, would I be the asshole to give an ultimatum for the product or the promised refund?

Edit: I've checked over past communications, in July the $35 refund was promised (for the 2 pieces as part of the 6 piece package) - still on the artist's to-do list. They also agreed to do to the other owed pieces within the month and it's certainly not July any more. Thanks for the positive response folks <3","1578108470.0","Not the A-hole","7","12"

This irritated me and so I kept walking and left them. 

A little bit later I called one of them to see if we could meet up somewhere because I felt bad for leaving them, but he didn't answer. So I called my sister and we did the hike together instead.

"ejpz2a","1578104061","WIBTA for telling my aunt I don't want her to join my trip to Japan?","I have had a pretty good relationship with my aunt, I love her a lot and enjoy spending time with her but her personality can be a bit much at times. She is the kind of person who is always concerned about other people, never wanting to be alone and always buying gifts for others even when there is no occasion, despite her habit of spending money recklessly. She is well into her forties and still relies on my grandparents and my father to help her get by financially every now and then.

I am a student working minimum wage and have been planning my perfectly curated dream trip to Japan for several years. I have organised all of the cities I want to go to, accommodation and transportation, activities and even sought out all of the vegan friendly restaurants! At the moment it's a solo trip, but I have been talking to a few *very close* friends about the possibly of them joining. All that's left to do is save up enough money and find the perfect time to book.

A few months ago I mentioned that I was saving up to go to Japan in front of my aunt. Her face immediately lit up and she told me she would love to go and that she would start saving up too so she could come with me. This was a very sudden declaration (and it's also pretty typical of her to get excitable and forget about things), so I just said nothing. Well, obviously she took that as a yes and it has since escalated. She now regularly brings it up, talking about where she wants to go, ideas for accomodation or even checking in and asking if I have enough money yet. She keeps talking about how she is so excited for, ""our trip to Japan"" even though I haven't invited her at any point. I have tried lying and told her that I can't afford to go and it was just a silly dream but she still insists we go, saying she has even less money than me and is still willing to pay. She now acts like the trip was her idea, and tells me she needs me to come with her to be her translator. At this point, I am so close to being ready to pay for my trip but I feel like I can't book anything until I tell her she is definitely not going, otherwise she may feel betrayed. I feel terrible because she tells me she has been saving up for it even though she doesn't have a lot of money but I also never asked her to.

tl;dr: Casually mentioned my plans to go to Japan which made aunt excited saying she wants to come as well, I never outright said yes or no because I didn't take her seriously but now she actually thinks we are going together even though I have already made the plans and am ready to book the trip without her.

I was 20 at the time and tried my hardest but in the end I couldn't handle working, going to school and being a single father. My parents tried to help but they were the other side of the country and it wasn't feasible. In the end my daughter was left with them whilst I finished school and tried to earn money. I visited as often as I could and when she was 2 I moved back to my parents to be with her.

My mother died when my daughter was 6 and my father fell apart, suddenly it was about me raising my daughter whilst working and looking after my father. I'll admit I wasn't the most attentive father as I just couldn't deal with it all and as she became a teenager I was rather strict with her. I didn't give her much freedom as I didn't want her to make the same mistakes as I did. I wanted to her to focus on her studies so that she'd  have a brighter future than I could provide for her.

When she was 18 she decided she didn't want to go to university and wanted to explore the world. This was fine with me and I explained she'd always have a home here to come back to no matter what she decided to do.

She travelled a lot with her friends but it seems by discovering the world she meant partying, doing drugs and excessive drinking. After about a year her funds ran out and she came home. She suddenly wanted to go to university and I was ecstatic about it. I offered to pay for her studies and even help her with rent and expenses if she wanted to move out. The only thing I asked in return was that she tone down her partying an no more drugs.

She decided to stay in the house with me and her grandfather in order to save money. At first everything was going great and she was focusing on her studies. Paying her purse wasn't bankrupting me but with medical bills for my father each month was quite tight. 
She passed her first year but that was the end of it. During her second year she stopped going to classes, wasn't coming home often and by the looks of social media was back to partying and drugs. I sat her down and explained she wasn't holding her end of the deal  but this just led to tears and screaming that I was stifling her.

At the end of this semester her attendance was so low that the university wanted to exclude her, however I explained her grandfather was sick and they agreed not to do anything as long as she did well in her Janurary exams.
I haven't seen her since before Christmas, she still texts to let me know she's ok but that's it. She's partying, back tending drugs and seems to not care about her studies. I also found out that despite me financing her she still took a student loan so she could have money to support her lifestyle.

I talked with my wife and got the ok. Later that night he told us he will be roasting a pig and we should pay for half. It’s not that bat so we do and we also bought the rest of the party things (about $180). 

Fast forward to New Year’s Eve and my wife, one year old son and I are all sick. My brother-in-law gets there at 9am starts drinking and cooking the pig. At 3pm he calls my wife gets off work and calls me to tell me my brother-in-law called my wife and told her to pick up my sister and her kids an hour way so they can go home in one car. My wife suffers from a medical condition that fatigues her all the time and had planned to nap before the party so she could make it to midnight. She didn’t want to drive the hour to pick them up so my brother-in-law goes instead. We are thinking they will get ready and be back around 6-7pm. Instead they show up at 4:30pm with their toddler and 3 month old. So no relaxing for my wife, our 1 year old or me. 

Before the party my sister says to my wife “oh we might stay just in case things get crazy”.  My wife and I had no idea that they planed to stay. My wife says “what do mean things get crazy”. My sister said “you know drunk drivers, people shooting or fireworks”. At this point my brother-in-law has bin drinking for almost 9 hours. My sister sed she bought an overnight bag just in case.

I told her I wanted to, and she said she reciprocated those feelings. I was head over heels for her, so when she called it off, I was devastated because I was losing my best friend/girlfriend that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with.

My boyfriend leaves with a couple of our friends to go get some food, because we're planning on eating some lunch and hang out for a bit and then going for a swim.

I knew I wanted to get sunscreen on now while I was under some shade and we were eating, to let it soak in before we went for our swim. I put it on my arms and legs and face and everything, but I was wearing a bikini and couldn't reach my back, so I decided to ask a friend \[20F\] who had stayed behind to help put some on my back. She agrees which I'm super thankful for, because I burn easily, and wanted to get as much sun protection as possible, so didn't want to wait for my boyfriend to get back because it wouldn't have had as much time to soak in. I didn't see any issue in having my friend help me out.

Now, I do want to note that I am openly bisexual and the friend I had asked is also openly bisexual, and is one of my good friends but my boyfriend doesn't know her as well. Her and I have only ever been friends though and have had no sexual history or anything together, we are purely platonic friends! But the fact that we are both bisexual is what this story hinges on.

So she helps me out and rubs it on the parts of my back that I can't reach. Now, my swim suit has a bunch of straps that criss cross all over it and on my upper back as well, and she had asked me if I wanted her to put sunscreen under the straps as well in case they moved while I was in the water. I agreed that that was a good idea so she reach her hand into the back of my swim suit and kept rubbing it on the centre and sides of my back to make sure everything was covered. We were also joking around and at one point she hugged me and jokingly kissed me on the cheek.

At this point my boyfriend gets back with our other friends and the food, and I can immediately see that he's angry at me. He pulls me aside and said he was upset that we had been ""flirting"" like that. He said that as he was walking back he could see her ""feeling me up"" and that because I was bisexual and I wanted her touching me, and that she didn't have to be reaching in to my swim suit to ""grope"" me like that. I told him he was completely wrong and nothing inappropriate had happened. He asked me how I would have felt if I had come back and seen an ""attractive woman"" rubbing sunscreen into his back, and I said that if it was one of our friends then that wouldn't bother me, but he told me I was lying. I told him that just because I was bisexual didn't mean that I want to jump everyone in sight, and that I'm capable of having platonic friends, even if they happen to be bisexual as well.

There were people already standing against the railing in the back so we stood behind two of them them in spots where we could see between the people. Even though the room was crowded, these particular people were taking up about a two and a half person space for each one of them. Still not a big deal for me because we could see between people. 
For the first hour of the show, there was about a 3/4 person space in front of me where if one person had scooted over a couple inches, we could have fit one person in that space with plenty of room.

I didn’t ask anyone to move over, wasn’t trying to scoot people in, wasn’t touching anyone, wasn’t blocking anyone’s view. 

The woman next to me yelled at me this was her space, tried to forcefully take the coat and throw it back at me.

By the time we arrive at the store we have half an hour to shop. We go looking for ingredients first thing item is watermelon, they have none. I point out watermelon slices but that won't do so we go to the freezer aisle to look for some. None.

At this point I'm like it's closing soon so can we go get everything else while you look up different cocktails. He says you can go grab what you want by yourself if you want to(I later found out that this was because I was rushing him and he was stressed out looking for cocktails when he said that and I made the wrong choice by separating) . I'm like yeah sweet I even pick up something for him while I'm shopping but then I couldn't find him when I finished and since they were closing I bought my stuff.

 Just as I finished I spotted him in an aisle the shop was dead so I just left my trolly and walked over and made a joke that I though he was in the car already but he was sort of snippy back and I just ignored it as we walked to the tills. One of his items was burst so he ran to get a replacement and I scanned all his items as I'm doing so I'm looking at the stuff he got and I'm like damm what will this concoction be like? Then he shows up pays for his stuff and we leave.

As we walk out of the store I ask him what he got and he just says ""I gave up, I'm not drinking. When I couldn't find you I just got sweets instead"" I take a minute and I say are you serious (I think he's joking). The car ride home is just music on the radio no talking. When we do get home we put everything away. Then sit kind of separate for half an hour. 

Eventually (after he asked me what's wrong) I say that I think he's so selfish that he just decides no cocktails without even mentioning it to me. Then just goes and gets himself sweets and whatever. He thinks I was in the wrong for separating and getting stuff that I needed when he offered that up to me.  I was supposed to stay and help look at cocktail recipes on his phone instead. He sees no problem in his behaviour.

He wanted to know where I was and I didn’t tell him where I was because it didn’t matter at the time. We get into an argument and I said some things that I shouldn’t have said. He said when it was my turn with him, he wouldn’t take me. I tried calling his bluff. He told me to turn around and go back with my mom because “I wasn’t your legal guardian so I don’t have to take care of you.” I go sit in the car and bawl my eyes out. Being told by someone that they don’t want to take care of you when they have for 13 years just because you aren’t their child. My half-sister joins me with my mom and we go home.

Come one month later and my grandma texts me asking if I wanted to still go on a train ride up the coast with my friend. I say yes and consult my mom. My mom and I both agree that just because I got into a fight with my dad doesn’t mean I have to cut contact with my grandma. So I say yes and make plans to go get lunch.

Near Christmas, we go to lunch because this is when my birthday is. She picks me up and we go to the restaurant. During eating she asks me how I’ve been and all that junk. She also asks me when I was going to apologize to my dad. Me apologize to him? Excuse me? I asked her what she means by this. She said that my dad feels hurt and that I need to apologize for it. I told her I wouldn’t ever apologize to him, even if he was standing on my deathbed. 

I talked to my mom after our lunch date.

My friend is really shy, but she wants to meet a man so I decided that I would go out with her and support her as her wingman. I’m engaged, so I don’t want any male attention. 

Yesterday we decided to hit up a popular bar/music venue to meet some people and hang out. I like to dress nicely. I wore a cropped sweater, a pencil skirt, some light makeup, heels, and jewelry. When she got to my house, she seemed annoyed with how I was dressed. She kept making sly comments. I offered to let her have a look in my closet if she wanted to change, and she didn’t. 

While we were at the bar, I thought everything was going great. We talked to a bunch of people. I introduced her to some guys. I thought we had a lot of fun. 

However, when we got back into the car she started crying. She told me that I was trying to steal the limelight from her and being an attention whore. I was supposed to be supporting her.  The guys that I introduced to her wanted to talk to me instead. I was like, “if you’re so desperate and blaming me why don’t you fix yourself up some so you can talk to more guys. It’s not my fault that I’m attractive.” 

She thought that I was saying that she’s unattractive, but that’s not what I meant. 
When I got back home I told my fiancé about the fight. He said that he kind of agreed with her, I should wear something simple to not “distract from the mission”.

"ejquz4","1578108207","AITA for leaving a comment on my aunts post","On phone this just crossed my mind.

So this happened almost a year ago and I’m still grieving. But my grandfather passed away with cancer. Long story short, he had a bunch of canes and his favorite one was a wooden one. My grandmother dressed his for the funeral (pick out clothes for him to wear in the casket) and it all matched his cane.

my family was sad, I personally didn’t get to go. So my grandmother was left alone there. While my mother and aunt was dealing with things. So my grandmother cousin apparently ask her for my grandfather cane that’s in his hands. Inside of the casket. She told us she asked her about 5 times before her cousin just brought over the cane (idk how she got it exactly) and she just said take it. She told us all this later that night after the funeral and everyone was MAD. Like about to hunt this lady down mad. 

I don’t remember the timeline of this happening but I know it wasn’t long after( like the next day or two) my aunt posted to Instagram. She tagged me, my mother, my cousins (her kids), some other random people. And my grandmother’s cousin. She saying “oh I miss my daddy, everyone tagged is family and we all loved him dearly. “ On and on .... (she was never around my grandparents if she was there it was just with my grandmother not her father) anyways I was already upset because there is a strict rule my grandparents wanted us to follow... don’t put them in the facebooks (which meant the internet) so I was pretty upset she put him on there. Then I saw the comment my grans cousin made it said “I truly miss him but my cousin gave me a life long memory that being his cane” Then I was soo angry I replied to it which I said “why would you take it, what makes you think it’s ok to ask her right now?” 

So everyone was upset with me but my mother and my brother. My grandmother didn’t seem to express her feelings. Or I don’t remember that time was a bit of a blur.  So idk I guess that’s it.  

she deleted my comment and called my mother saying I shouldn’t have said anything. And grans cousin called saying she sorry but she said she could have it. Now that I have had nearly a year to look back I think I am wrong. Because I never act like that. But I told her not to tag me on anything. But whatever, she blocked me on Instagram. And my phone number? I just learned this. My grandmother says she ask about me all the time. But I really don’t want to deal with them.

"ejqwmq","1578108429","AITA for being upset that I can't play my Christmas present?","Info: I have no siblings, am a sophomore in HS, and live at home. We're middle-class & moved last April. My mom is part-time; my dad works full-time, early.

This Christmas, I got a PS4 + PSVR from my parents. I was super excited because I'd been wanting one for a long time. I started wanting VR around June of this year after playing it during vacation with a friend but didn't think we could afford one. Around early November, we were discussing presents.

I didn't really know what I wanted, but my parents suggested a gaming system or VR. I was ecstatic but didn't know much about many gaming systems and I thought VR would be too expensive. They said to do research, and I found a PSVR; however, it needed a PS4 and I thought it was still too expensive.

My mom ended up getting a deal on it, so it wasn't too bad but it was definitely the most exciting & most expensive Christmas I'd ever gotten. I saw it when it arrived sometime in November, and was dying to play it ever since. Finally, Christmas rolled around, and I got to open the gift. I thanked my parents profusely.

I set the playstation up on my own; I had to wait until the next day to play it as we went to my grandparent's house. I had a few games to play, and was content for that day because who wouldn't be?

Then, we went to a retreat with family for three days. I was not allowed to bring the PS4 or VR. I got more games there and was hyped to be able to play them when we got back home.

We got back home and I've only been able to play it 2-3 time, for about an hour or less each time. I can't help but feel disappointed that the only gift I could interact with was unusable. I don't say this to undermean the other gifts; I do appreciate them as well and have made that clear, but the PS4/VR set is the only gift I can actually interact with.

Here's the issue: Every time I go to play, I'm told that the TV is in use or that it's too late (noise). When I have gotten to play, my mom will watch and complain about me using the TV or comment on each thing I do in-game. I've asked my parents nicely if they could let me play on my own/try not to talk to me unless they need/want me to do something, but they won't. And so the little time that I've gotten to play is often interrupted every five minutes or so.

We have a rec room that I initially wanted to set my things up in; my mom said she'd empty it out (she has a lot of stuff she wants to sell) and get furniture down there over Christmas break, but she ended up not doing it. The only other place that has a TV right now is my dad's room, and he definitely wouldn't let me set anything up in there.

Tonight, I went to my room after having this happen again when trying to play and tried venting to some friends over Discord. They called me entitled and said that I'm taking things for granted and being insensitive to people who aren't as fortunate as me. So, I came here to ask: AITA?","1578108627.0","No A-holes here","3","17"

I (M42) recently grounded my daughter and I would like to hear the takes of some of her peers. I do not want to be overly harsh to her and do wish to treat her fairly.

So my daughter (F15) likes wearing tight leggings. I personally find them inappropriate but I do not want to control her and wish to give her flexibility in expressing herself. I have told her my thoughts on them but I also made her clear that I wish to respect her choices and support her decision. I had a more conservative upbringing and wish to be kinder for my daughter.  
For context, I have sole custody, her mother is not in the picture.

However, earlier today I saw one of her friends (M14) tell her that her ""booty looks nice"" (pains me to write that) and my daughter essentially moves her hand in a motion to advertise it to him. Her friend responds by slapping it and grabbing it (disgusting). I later asked my daughter about this and said that she is just fooling around and having fun the way all young women do. I said that I while do support her decisions, I cannot endorse her acting the way and that it would be better if she stopped. She got really mad, called me a mysoginist, and said that she has the right to enjoy her life.

My family and I try to treat her like family, especially since her family is from a different area of the country. However, she seems to have a totally different attitude towards people doing her favors. When I do her favors, she will never thank me, and will often be critical of the nature of quality of whatever favor I’ve done. I won’t go into a lot of examples, I’ll just say it’s a lot of little things. Like, when I make food, everyone else in the family will thank me, but she’ll have a criticism of its taste or texture or whatever else.

Things came to a head this past weekend. Her story, she noticed that her tire had leak and got a “low tire pressure” light. Despite noticing this, she got onto a busy highway with the car, had a tire blowout, and was stranded. She doesn’t have a roadside service and didn’t want a high fee for it, and has no idea to change a tire, so I went really out of my way to bring her tools and help her change out the tire for the spare. Once again, on the side of a busy, dangerous highway. She didn’t thank me once for going out of our way to help her. I was fine with doing it but all I got from her was low-level irritation about my not arriving fast enough and it being cold and it not being warm enough in my car. So I said, “by the way, you’re WELCOME for coming to help you.” She said, “what’s that supposed to mean?” I said, “I think you know” and dropped the subject. 

I got an earful from my brother about how she grew up in a bad family situation, and they weren’t big on thanks or praise. So I should just accept that sometimes she won’t “lavish me with thanks.” I said that it’s not an excuse for being so rude, that she’s had plenty of time to observe that our family doesn’t work that way. And now everyone’s pissed. My Dad said “maybe you shouldn’t do things expecting people to praise you.” And I feel petty for even bringing it up to her, but honestly if I’d said nothing and just let my frustration build I feel like it could have been worse.

During the 1st month of my 1st year, my mom had access to my email in case I got any from the financial aid office or anything. After a month, I realized it was kind of weird that my mom could read any of my emails. I wanted independence, so I asked her to stop and she said ok. I told her I'd forward anything she needed me to.

Few months later, open my email to see that there are emails on read I never opened. Asked my mom, she said she didn't do it. That was that.

Cut to junior year. No incidents since (I think). My mom calls me towards the end of the semester and brought up that I had an assignment due in a few days. I asked how she knew that. She said she had access to my Canvas account and has been checking since I started school. I don't know how she got access to it. She had been snooping for 3 years without me knowing and it really makes me feel like she doesn't trust me. I had been turning in almost every single assignment (I'm not perfect, I'm sure I missed a couple). I confronted her about it once I got home. I didn't yell or anything, I just told her that she needed to see my perspective and how it makes me feel like she doesn't trust me, considering I have been doing just about everything I've been needing to. I saw her side, but she wouldn't see mine.

Few hours later, in my room, on my laptop, door closed. All of a sudden, she walks in, sits on my bed, and closes my laptop. She starts tearing up and says how nobody in this family appreciates what she does and how it's ""a motherly thing"" and ""you'll understand when you have kids"". Didn't know what to say to her because I was shocked at what happened, and she said ""Fine, silent treatment? Whatever."" and walked out and didn't talk to me until the next day. Even then, she just kept making me feel guilty and kept saying ""Oh, you don't love me anymore?"" or ""Do you hate me now?"".

Cut to 2 days ago. At this point, I ended up transferring to another university because of her job transferring her out of the state and her demanding that I come with her or she won't help me pay for school (an issue for another day). Just finished my first semester, home for break. Out at dinner. She asks me ""Have you checked your grades?"". I said, jokingly ""I don't know, have you?"", and her face turned white. Turns out, she got into my new canvas account and had been checking my grades and emails behind my back again. I asked her about the emails, and she denied it. When I told my family that she used to read/delete my emails, she said ""I don't delete them anymore"", meaning she still reads that after I've asked her not to. It was really embarrassing having to deal with this in public in front of my family. However, they didn't see an issue with it and ganged up on me. I was the one driving, so on the drive home, I put in my headphones to ignore everything, and I could hear them saying how I'm overreacting, being antisocial, and acting like a baby.

"ejr6nb","1578109754","AITA for not wanting to pay for my ex-husbands tattoo.","So, This is a little bit hard to summarise but I'm going to try.

For 12 months I didn't realise I was paying my ex-husbands phone bill because I didn't look at the dates properly and expected to see the company on the bank statement for my phone bill and didn't question it. 

When we were together he spent £200 on me over the course of 2 birthdays. 

He didn't know what he wanted for his so I offered to pay money towards a tattoo he wanted but hadn't designed yet.

The relationship unfortunately fell apart and I moved out but we tried to make it work still. One of the first things he asked when I moved out was whether I'd still pay for the tattoo. I agreed since we were trying to work things out.

Didn't happen as we officially broke up but were still friends. 

Then he said he didn't want anything to do with me since I was hanging out with an old friend he'd hate for as long as we'd been together. My ex was paranoid about me cheating with this friend so I stopped speaking to him for over a year but we bumped into each other. 

So after telling me he wants nothing to do with me, I hear nothing more from my ex until I need to bring up the phone bill.

Long story short, three hours of arguing and sending photos of bank statements and mobile account statements, he finally believes that he owes me £500 + £42 pcm. 

He agrees the monthly and starts paying it. 

He doesn't have a job so can't pay the £500 yet. Give him a month, back in contact and he has a job. Give him another month to sort out any outstanding finances etc. but then it's December, give him until January because Xmas and so on. 

He then asks to knock off £250 for my share of the divorce fee when we finalise everything/apply to Court. I agree.

Little while later, he asks to knock of the £250 for the tattoo (which was actually £225). I say I need to think about it but he keeps pushing. Circumstances were different when I agreed to pay it. He told me he didn't even want to speak to me anymore, but still thinks I should honour his birthday money?

But as I was about to leave, another shift lead called and told me I most likely didn't need to come in. She said to be ""on-call"" for an hour, but after that I shouldn't worry about it. An hour passed and they didn't call me in, so I excitedly made plans with a friend.

However, a few minutes later, my coworker messaged me saying she had a chronic knee problem flare up and asked if I could cover her shift right now. Historically, she's asked me several other times (within an hour of the shift) if I could cover, and I've said no. I said no this time as well, but I feel like an asshole now because technically I'm ""on call"" so maybe it was wrong for me to have made other plans. But on the other hand, I figured it was okay - if she really needed a cover she could talk to my shift lead and they'd call me in. Would suck because I'd have to hang out with my friend a few hours later than planned, but it would be okay and I'd go in at that point. But it seems like she hasn't talked to the shift lead about this because I haven't heard any further news.

I finished and sat on a bench that was in the middle of both entrance/exits. So no matter which door I went out it was an equal distance walk. There’s a little pickup area in front of the store between the entrance/exits so that’s where my driver was

When I got the notification he was outside, I started walking towards one of the exits. It was 30 seconds max to reach the door and be outside. I didn’t see his red car anywhere. I opened the app again and saw that he was driving away. He took a turn towards the back of the store and drove slowly behind the store. I thought maybe he was just circling the building. He ended up missing the turn back to the parking lot and drove on the next street. Keep in mind I was outside in the cold while all of this played out

When I saw him driving away towards the back of the store and I told him “I’m on the grocery side”. No answer. So I called him when I saw him still driving behind the store. No answer. When he turned onto that other street I mentioned I said “where are you” “can you come to the grocery side please”. No answer! I called again. He DECLINED it. It only rang two times

By the time he declined my call, there was only 60 seconds left before he could cancel the ride and get my $5 “no show” fee. I think I tried to call one more time when I saw he ended up parking behind the store. If anyone reading this has been to meijer, then you know that it’s huge and it would’ve taken a couple minutes to walk there. Plus it was dark outside and I definitely wouldn’t be comfortable walking behind the store where no one else would be

Anyways, I was pissed that he didn’t attempt to contact me or find me after I didn’t show up for less than a minute. I understand they don’t like to wait but if you’re just gonna drive away like that because I’m not there then why not attempt to contact me first?

The reason I think he just wanted the no show fee was because I’ve heard it about that from a couple drivers. There’s been times where I’d be rushing to get outside and they’ll end up waiting 2-3 minutes. A few times they’d say something like “that’s alright, I know some drivers that would automatically cancel it without waiting the 5 minutes”. I’ve also read about it on the Lyft subreddit

After he canceled it, I got a notifi that said something like “Oh no! Sorry you couldn’t make it, we had to charge you a $5 no show fee to compensate our drivers.” I immediately opened lyft live chat and told them what happened. They refunded my $5 fee and gave me an extra $5 credit. I probably wouldn’t have cared as much to live chat if I didn’t get charged the fee

After I finished talking to them, the app prompted me to give feedback on the driver. I ended up getting another $5 credit

We've never had any communication since she left but a few weeks ago, she found me on Facebook and messaged me. She sent me my goddaughter's baptismal certificate where she listed me as one of the godmothers and signed for me because I couldn't be there to attend (my nanny lived at another province). 

Now, she's starting to ask for gifts because she said I missed too many Christmases and birthdays. You might find me TA for saying this but to be honest, I don't consider the child as my goddaughter because I believe I wasn't mature enough back then to be a responsible godmother.

When we arrived, my grandpa started to visit with one of my siblings so the other and I went and talked with my nana for a minute. When we all finished our conversations, my grandpa greeted my other sibling and walked into the restaurant without even acknowledging me. That's fine. Nothing new.

We chose a table to sit at and took a look at the menu. I purposely chose to sit next to my grandpa so I could talk with him and make up for not speaking with him outside. After we ordered our food I tried to make conversation with him by asking questions like ""How have you been?"" and ""What have you been up to lately?"" Nothing. He would ignore everything I said until someone else asked. It stung a bit but it wasn't completely unexpected.

But what broke me was after our meal. We were all saying our goodbyes and love yous. I hugged my nana, waited for my siblings to say bye to my grandpa, and walked to him. He didn't even look at me. He just turned and walked away.

I felt betrayed. I waited until we were in the car to leave and just started crying like a little shit. What he did probably wouldn't have hurt as bad as it did if we weren't going through the separation already. I told my mom what happend when we got to where we were living. She has said to me many times that I'm old enough to be able to decide who I want to communicate with in my life so I told her I wanted nothing to do with that grandparent any more. It wasn't the first time he did something like that and most likely wouldn't be the last. He showed me that even at my low points he didn't really care for me.

My family says that I'm being too harsh and family is family no matter what. They say he was probably just having a rough day and didn't mean anything by it. But my friends and some teachers are telling me that he is a bad influence and is just hurting me. I don't know if this is too harsh because he is my grandpa and he might not mean any harm. He could think he's just playing around with me. But on the other hand he knows how I feel about it and constantly makes me feel awful about myself.

I (M,23) live in the same apartment complex as my mate who was part of the party and we decided to drop off the other 2 friends first since out of convenience. 

Bear in mind I'm new to using Didi (mainly use it because it's cheaper than uber) and so I'm still learning how to add in extra addresses to make the trip easier for the driver. Anyway so we drop the first friend off at home, and while we're sitting in the car in front of the house, in trying to add in the next address... The Didi app won't let me :/ so the driver tells me to pay for the first trip and then request a new one with the address. I try this and it won't let me request a new driver... 

My mate in the back (let's call him Andy) starts getting annoyed out of nowhere because we aren't moving and starts telling me to hurry up. I tell him I'm trying to add in the next address for the other friend in our car and tells me I'm not doing good enough. So then I try explaining to him that the app isn't working and it's not letting me request a new route, which is what the driver suggested I do. Andy isn't listening tells me to hurry up again and order a new one. At this point I'm starting to get annoyed because I'm trying to get everyone home, and Andy is starting to get shitty at me for not being able to get Didi to work. The driver then tells me that his app isn't working either and we're both thinking of how we can fix the app to get the next address to show. 

This next part is where I may have over-reacted (idk), but Andy tells me that he could've ordered a Didi by now and gotten home, and so I told him that if all he's gonna do is complain then he can get out of the car and get himself home. So he hops out of the car and starts walking down the street to find another ride. My driver then tells.me to forget about the app and he'll give me a free trip back to the next address and then take me home (also for free). At the same token, he also drives up to Andy and asks him to get back in the car and he'll take him home for free. Andy refuses and now I'm trying to get him back in the car along with our other friend. After several attempts to get him back in, the driver gives up and drives the rest of us home, while Andy is waiting for his next Didi to pick him up. As my driver drops me off, I tip him for the inconvenience of the app breaking and the drama that went on. He thanks me and then we part ways. 

Tldr: I booked a Didi to drop myself and friends home from a night out drinking, one of the friends is annoying me for getting stuck at the first of 3 addresses and so I told him to get his own lift home if he doesn't think I'm doing a good enough job.","False","Not the A-hole","9","16"

There have been multiple occasions when him, our group of about 4 other friends and I have all gone out to dinner and he's ordered and eaten everything then when the checks come he's forgotten his wallet or he didn't have enough money to eat out in the first place and didn't tell us. 

He also doesn't have a driver's license and since we live in the middle of suburban America we, the friend group, need to give him a ride most of the time we want to do anything and this often means going out of the way to pick him up from work. I say most of the time because it's not everytime, he uber's sometimes but he'll never tell us if he needs a ride until it's too late and the person  picking him up will be late as well.

Most recently we all planned to go to dinner and agreed to meet at 7:30, he agreed to go to dinner saying that he would get off work at 7:30 but he would still make it.
At 7:00 he messages the group saying that he's gotten off work early. At 7:20 he asks if anyone can give him a ride. The restaurant we all agreed to go to is right next to our houses and his work is 10 minutes away so whoever picks him up is gonna be 10 minutes late. 
Once we get to the restaurant we're all having a good time and everything and he's talking about how he's just bought The Outer Worlds and he's loving it and how good a game it is. Then the checks come and it's one of the restaurants where you gotta pay at the front, as were all standing up to go pay he says to me ""Hey can you pay for me?"" 
It wasn't much, only $15 after tip, but it's not the money that i care about it's the principle of the thing and this kinda thing happens too often. We've tried talking to him about it but he doesn't listen it just goes in one ear and back out the other. 

Honestly I'm sick of covering for him, I don't want to pay for him anymore or give him anymore rides or anything, I'm his friend not his babysitter.

"ejryde","1578113539","AITA for Walking Away from my Girlfriend After Giving Her a Gift?","So a few months back around Halloween season, I decided to get my girlfriend (now ex) a gift. We'll call her K.

I knew that the Halloween/October season was her favourite time of the year, and as something that she'd hopefully appreciate I gave her a gift bag full of candies, chocolates, and a little witch. This was all spooky themed as it was intended to be that way.

Now keep in mind that although it was a pretty simple gift, I put a lot of thought into it. Being my age, it took me a whole day to gather everything and put together.

Now I waited until K and I got out of school to have her look inside. She told me that she would when she got home. I asked her nicely if she could just open it (as I was hoping for a sincere, surprised reaction). Instead she turned to me, took one split second glance inside, and gave me the nastiest most sarcastic ""thanks"" I've ever heard.

I was shocked to see her shut down my attempt at being caring. I thought it would be a cute, fun thing to make her smile and that's all I wanted to see. I've never seen someone give as strong an expression to something with good intent.

Within a few seconds I turned around and left, still unable to comprehend why that happened.

We talked afterwards and basically went over what happened. This is around the time that things started falling apart, I believe this is what showed me the off side of her.

I've had this in the back of my mind for a while now, AITA for walking away from her like that? Was it justified or was it wrong of me to do so?

Now I know a lot of you would find this funny due to my age (if you've read my name). I would like real opinions though because this could become a learning opportunity for me, and allow me to better my future decisions.

We were walking through the toy section when he saw a used baby doll that they were selling for something ridiculously low like 50 cents because it was almost over. He thought it was ""sad"" that nobody wanted the doll so he bought it and said maybe he could donate it to a school or see if any Facebook friends could benefit from it.

However, a couple days later it became apparent that he likes the doll. He has to wake up extremely early for work and I saw him holding it and watching the morning news once when I got up to pee, I think I've heard him talking to it, etc. 

We've talked about having kids of our own in the future and I love him very much and it makes me happy that he has fatherly tendencies, but I think it's...weird that grown man is playing with a doll and it makes me a little uncomfortable.

I take weight training in school, so I really need the protein that meat provides, and meat is just really delicious. My parents are not huge meat eaters, and they set aside almost all of the meat for me every single meal. 

Recently, my mom started researching different diets in her spare time and decided to try being vegetarian. She brought up the idea about a week ago, and I was like ""cool, you should try it."" I guess I wasn't clear enough about the fact that ""you"" didn't include ""me"" because she bought a week's worth of groceries without any meat. I was shocked when I found out, mainly because I thought her vegetarian diet would just be eating more of the vegetables from our usual meals and skipping meat entirely. Apparently, she thought that I was giving her the go ahead to force a vegetarian diet on everyone in the family. 

Today, when she was going grocery shopping at Costco, I specifically told her that I would like her to buy some meat for me. I hadn't eaten meat for a week, and I hadn't complained about her meals too much, so I thought she would recognize that I had stomached a week of vegetarianism for her sake and wanted to resume having meat in my diet. I said that I was okay with eating meat every other day, but she said that she ""liked this strict vegetarian diet and wanted to continue it."" I didn't get angry with her, and I just said that ""I really would not like to eat another week of this."" She brought up the fact that my dad wasn't complaining, but my dad just eats whatever she makes since he eats everything but chicken. The conversation was civil, but despite my explicit disapproval and protest, she did not buy any meat. 

I told my friends what happened, and most of them agree that I was spoiled for insisting on eating meat. I come from a very well off family, I know I am very privileged, and I really appreciate everything my mom does for me, which is why I did not get angry with her during our conversation.

My husband and I have been apart 6 months and I have been living with my mom and step dad in the meantime. We are filing next week, it’ll be done and over with, and I’m trying to pick up and go on. 
I won’t go into the reasons why we’re getting divorced, it doesn’t matter here. However, select people in my life and in my husband’s life know what is going on. It’s nothing either of us wants to shout from the rooftops. 
In recent conversations my mother has told me instances in which she has shared the details of my separation with coworkers, friends, family members, etc in an effort to let me know these people are “thinking about me”. I have made it known I’m not happy about that and it is not her information to share. It’s always something in intimate detail that is shared with these people, complete with examples. 

Tonight she told me she ran into an aunt of mine (idk what to call her, moms brothers sister) who we don’t see often. Aunt asked about my husband and I and instead of leaving it at “they are no longer together” and “that’s not my information to share” as a follow up, my mother tells me examples she has given to my Aunt as to why I could not stay in my marriage. Detailed examples. And furthermore throwing my current husband under the bus entirely. Clearly, I was not happy about this. I was very conscious of speaking with my mom in a calm tone and not popping off. I told her I had not deemed my distant Aunt a person I wanted to share any details with and once again asked her why she felt the need to tell people intimate details of my life. If anyone is allowed to spout off details it’s my husband or myself, not my own mother. 
Long story short, my mom was enraged. Yelling at me, being generally defensive, and in the end slamming her door when she walked away. My step dad who witnessed the entire thing told me to be quiet and stop talking. She’s mad, he’s mad, and I’ve been made to feel like the one out of line for once again asking that my personal life stay between me and my immediate family/the ones I choose to share it with.

They are my brother's and sister-in-law's kids (for clarification). My sister-in-law has a large family and has always been very close to her parents and other family members, who are quite traditional people. They don't exactly love me (what they know of me) for various reasons.

My SIL's dad has traditionally taken his grandsons--and not his granddaughters--hunting, fishing, and camping. My niece is a bit of a tomboy, LOVES the outdoors, and is really close with her big brother. Ever since her brother first got to go (at age \~7?) she's been begging to go on one of the trips with them. Finally in the last year they took her along on one of the camping trips--but she didn't have a very good time because she said they didn't wait up for her and some of her older cousins made fun of her when she didn't know stuff like how to use a latrine pit and did things like play keep-away with their bottles of bugspray, etc. According to my SIL her grandfather said she just couldn't keep up and her medical issues (she has some mild seasonal allergies and mild asthma) meant he wasn't comfortable ever bringing her on a camping trip again. She's devastated.

I'm not in a position to take my niblings camping right now but I have taken them hiking before and can confirm that as long as you hike at a child-friendly pace and make sure my niece took her allergy pill if it's springtime she's more than fine. They have a great time, she keeps up and is interested and doesn't complain. She's never needed her asthma puffer either so that's not a big deal (she's starting to grow out of it and might not need to carry it soon). I'd love to take them camping with me and my partner as soon as we get a vehicle that can support that kind of excursion and have a great and positive experience with both my niblings! We think this year is going to be the year.

As a sort of tie-in with all the hiking stuff my SIL's parents usually gift their grandsons an engraved knife/multi-tool on their 10th birthdays and their granddad/uncles are usually really pro-active in teaching them to use it and be responsible with it. It's a big deal to them. My niece has seen her brother get his and their uncles showing him cool things with it and would love to have one. Their grandparents give their granddaughters a fancy monogrammed backpack on their 10th but she isn't very excited about that.

I'm thinking about getting her an engraved multi-tool of her own on her 10th birthday, which is coming up. However I don't want to rock the boat as I don't think my brother's in-laws/SIL parents would be super happy about that. As I said they don't like me already. I haven't even brought it up with my brother because I'm sure he'd say yes (he's pretty mad about the camping trip already) because he's never been good at thinking about the consequences. WIBTA?

Since we’re in our mid 20s, we usually just have a chill night in but the tradition still carries on. 

One of the girls, let’s call her Abbie, got broken up with by her boyfriend of 1.5 years last September. Ever since then she has been begging for him to give her another chance or insisting to him that they can be friends. Every single day leading up to the break up all of our text messages and conversations during our night in has been about her relationship and the ex. I had been very patient and always reminded her that it’s not worth it to try to hold on someone that can’t be hold on too. I suggested for her to move on. She’s still seeing and talking to him constantly even after all these. Her reasoning is she needs closure and SHE uses him for sex. I clearly knew the reason she did was because she didn’t wanna let go. 

Yesterday night we had our usual night in and all 6 of us were there. Abbie began her usual venting about her ex. And then all of the sudden another girl in the group stopped her and showed us a screenshot of Abbie’s ex on a dating app, bumble. Abbie lost it and just started venting and letting everybody knows how sorry she was that her ex missed something as amazing as she is. 

Well Abbie wasn’t the only person who lost it. I did too. I just couldn’t take it anymore pretending to care about this whole situation after 3.5 months. I told her to move on a bunch of times and told her to stop talking/seeing him. Every time I said that she always said that she didn’t need to be judged.

So a couple of days ago, I went to a store where we had to get numbers to be served. I was slightly confused about the system and eventually went up to the counter to get a slip with a number on it. As I was looking for the slips, a stranger comes up to me and gives me her number and says ""here you go, you can have my number"" and walks away. Ok.. random... but I was not going to refuse and I couldn't find the slips anyways.

A minute later, another lady (B) comes up to me asks what number I have. ""I have number 54...someone gave it to me"". She goes, ""oh, I have number 58...they already called your number"" and walks away. I look at the monitor and it says that they are serving number 39, so I don't worry too much and go stand aside to wait. 20 minutes pass when the people serving call my number and I go ""here"". By this time, at least another 7 or so people have gotten numbers.

Suddenly, B starts yelling at me and the person behind the counter that I ""cut in line"" ""that's not her number"" ""it isn't fair to the rest of us who had to wait"" ""someone else gave her their number"". I was completely blindsided and felt publicly humiliated because the place was really busy and everyone was just staring at us. I just ignored her and talked to the guy behind the counter. He just shook his head and said ""I can't serve you. That's not your number"". I was really upset. He started serving the next customer and ignored me.

I then walked out of the store because I did not have the time to wait another 20 minutes to be served for something that will take 3 minutes, tops because at least 10 people have gotten in line since I got there.

I am very careful with him, and boyfriend is one of the few other people the dog is cool with.

"ejsfz4","1578116184","AITA for not wanting to speak to my MIL after she stole my Christmas present?","I have been dating my SO for just over two years. He has two daughters from a previous marriage who are now 13 and (almost) 15. I do not have kids, nor did I have any interest in dating someone with kids, but life is weird and the unexpected happens and I love their father and want to make this work. Things have been finally going well over the last few weeks and I’m starting to feel like we’re becoming a family. I know with their ages that I only have a few more years until they are off living their own lives. 

One of the things I have used to bond with the kids is that all three of us love Harry Styles. I saw he was coming in concert later this year and had been trying to save up to buy tickets to his concert for the kids for Christmas. 

A few weeks ago the four of us were at dinner with my MIL and the concert got brought up and how the three of us wanted to go. My MIL told my SO that she would buy the tickets for Christmas. My SO told her to buy three tickets and I would take them. 

Christmas comes and my MIL comes over with her gifts. The kids open their gift and there is a ticket in each of their box. I open my gift and there is a blanket and a DNA test. I was confused because I did not ask for either of these things and there was no ticket in my box. I didn’t want to be rude so I thanked her for the gifts. She then proceeded to tell the kids she bought another ticket and she will be taking them to the concert. I was in such shock I excused myself to my bedroom and stayed there until she left. 

I told my SO how upset I was. That this was supposed to be my thing to bond with the kids and his mother basically stole it from me. If I had known she wasn’t going to give me the third ticket I would have never agreed to her buying the tickets and bought them myself. He told me he was shocked and confused too but did not want to cause a potential fight on Christmas. He would talk to her about it later that week and tell her I am suppose to be the one to take the kids. I made a very firm stance that if she isn’t willing to give me her ticket then I do not want to see or speak to her for some time until I forgive her. 

Fast forward to now- my SO still has not spoken to his mother. Everyday that passes I get more angry and upset about it and it’s starting to effect my mood, especially toward my SO. I feel like I’m putting my SO in between me and his mother over something silly but I feel like what she did was so hurtful. AITA for pushing my SO to try to fix this and not wanting anything to do with my MIL unless she gives me the ticket? 

TL;DR: Was going to buy concert tickets for my SOs kids and myself. MIL offered to buy tickets; MIL gave two tickets to kids and kept the third one for herself.","1578123910.0","Not the A-hole","740","276"

"ejsieo","1578116559","AITA for firing a colleague with PTSD?","I have PTSD (combat/kinetic-situation based/caused), so I'm familiar with all the lovely issues that go hand-in-hand with it, like shakes, stress, panic attacks, unexpectedly re-living a situation, etc.; good times. I've also spent 8 years getting past it to the best of my abilities, and laying off of self-medication to ""cope"" with it (i.e. booze).

&#x200B;

As of a couple years ago, I'm finally in a good point in my life (engaged, steady senior/high-paying job, house is paid off, and so on). I'm climbing the corporate ladder in a fortune 500 engineering firm, and have finally reached the point where I'm allowed/required to hand off any/all non-leadership/non-engineering work to HR. Each engineering ""fellow"" typically has 1-2 ladies from HR that handle our individual schedules, e-mail/calendar delegation, etc.; for the sake of consistency. Fellows and management are discouraged from asking someone else's HR assistant for help unless his own staff is on vacation for more than 3 days, to avoid over-working or stressing out HR staff (especially the helpful/competent ones, which people tend to take for granted).

&#x200B;

One of my HR assistants has been on sick leave for 3 weeks (plus several more) to visit sick parents overseas, and recently my other assistant went on parental leave (which the team celebrated and for which we prepared a gift basket of baby clothes plus a car seat). **The replacement (""Tia"") that was recently hired has become a nightmare.** In short, a young, seemingly competent lady, but she can't handle deadlines or stress at all. This would at least be remotely manageable, but two HR members coaching her confided in me that Tia told her colleagues she can't manage working under me, because I remind her of an abusive ex (due to my height, skin color, and muscular build). Within a day, a couple junior HR staff come to me to ask why there are allegations of me abusing ""Tia"" physically. Enough is enough: I call in Tia, and demand a straightforward explanation now. She admits to ""likening"" me to her ex, but ""doesn't think"" she said I was abusive. I have a hard-earned reputation to defend and family to provide for. Tia is fired with cause, and blacklisted from our company and partners.

&#x200B;

Tia is now in the hospital with self-inflicted liver damage, and apparently has a history of PTSD. I don't care: she had no excuse in projecting and nearly ruining my career and ability to provide for my family.

After this, she started acting weird.She'd ask to see my son a lot and offer to babysit etc which wasn't weird by itself but then she started treating him like he was much younger. Baby talking to him, trying to swaddle him etc. It made me super uncomfortable (it was like she was close to being delusional) and my husband and I stopped letting her see him. At first I'd just make excuses and say my son had xyz things to do but then eventually just told her husband I didn't feel comfortable with him being around her.

She'd call and say things like she missed her baby (referring to my son) but I'd just say make some excuse.Her behaviour got even weirder for a while, she started treating her cat like a baby (putting the cat in a pram and walking around etc) and I just essentially cut her off.

I refused saying that I was still uncomfortable. She started begging and saying she really missed her nephew etc but eventually said she understood. But then she must've also asked my husband cause he was trying to convince me to let her see him and saying that he wants it to be a joint decision but he might just let his sister see him cause ""he's my son too"". My in laws are also taking SIL's side. They've gone so far as to say I'm being heartless when I'm just trying to protect my child. I just don't want him exposed to all this.

"ejso57","1578117457","AITA for refusing to go to the beach with my boyfriend?","I think this is a really stupid conflict, but it comes up often enough that I’ve decided to come to Reddit for judgement.

My boyfriend [23M] originally comes from a cold country and moved to my [23F] very warm home country last year. He is obsessed with the beach/pools/going swimming, he can and does spend hours just splashing around. I, on the other hand, hate going to the beach/pools. I’m happy to swim a few laps every now and then, but I quickly get bored of being in the water and lying in the sun on the beach/by the pool is even less entertaining. I have nothing against the beach and totally get why it appeals to him, I’ve just never enjoyed it.

Here’s the problem: it’s summer here and he CONSTANTLY wants to go to swimming. Every other day he asks me to drive him to the beach/local pool/my family’s house with a pool. I’m more than happy for him to go and have a ball, but he insists that I come with him because “it’s not fun alone” and also because he can’t drive, so he wants me to drive him there and back rather than taking public transport. He also says he doesn’t know how long he’ll be in my country, so I should help him make the most of his time here. The few times I have gone with him, he also INSISTS I get in the water and will get shitty if I don’t, so I can’t even go and read a book in a nearby park or something.

I’ve driven him a few times (3-4 in the last 6 months) but usually I just tell him he can go if he wants but I’m not interested, so I’m not driving him/sitting on a beach waiting.

Well now he’s saying that I’m an asshole for refusing to come with him and swim even though I don’t want to/it doesn’t interest me. He insists I’m in the wrong because it would be “so easy” for me to just take him, but I say it would be so easy for him to go by himself.

So Reddit, AITA?

EDIT TO ADD: The reason it’s only been 3-4 times in the last 6 months is largely because of our schedules - I work full time and he works part time, and our days overlap, so we rarely get days off together. When we do I’m okay to go for a trip to the beach/pool/wherever. But he always asks me to take him when he had the day off and I don’t, so I have to come straight from work and drive him to the beach. 

He is perfectly capable of getting on a bus to the beach (20 mins) himself on his 4 days off each week, but chooses not to.","1578118945.0","No A-holes here","12","29"

My mom & bros share the same views as him, but I would consider my family a bit extreme. They've openly mocked LGBTQ+ people (not like a funny joke, openly question/mock their existence) not just in news stories, but they’ve played “Guess the Gender” with a lot of my friends from college.

For religion, I just don’t believe in the same things they do. I do go to church with them, but not only are THEY religious, my uncle is a hardcore evangelist & has forced me to go to church A LOT. We’ve had a lot of family on his side pass, so I get they use it to cope, so I don’t contest it. Whatever makes them happy.

The 1 time I contested their political viewpoint was at dinner regarding the Hamilton/Pence thing, & my dad stormed out of the room & said to my mom: “We shouldn’t have sent her to such a liberal school, maybe she can still transfer”. 2 years later, my mom ended up getting a job transfer & said “If you don’t move with me, I’m not paying”, so I complied.

Any time I wanted to stay at school for a few extra days, my parents always say “You’re staying so you don’t have to see us, huh?” & “You don't love us anymore”. I never stay at school for more than 1 extra day now.

Mom has a solid job, Dad has been in & out of jobs. My bro (23M) graduated last year & is just chilling, switching between hobbies but no jobs. My oldest bro (25M) barely graduated HS, no uni., no job, & my parents are ""ok"" with it.

We are all adults in our late 20’s/early 30’s. I gave my blessing when my friend A wanted to ask my other friend, B, on a date. 

The date didn’t go well. B let A down gently and that was that. No hard feelings.

So my birthday comes around and both are attending my dinner celebration. It was fine, not awkward. A had to leave early. Somehow their date got brought up after he left. I honestly don’t remember by who because I wasn’t paying much attention to that, but the conversation was making me uncomfortable. B gave her honest impression, not harshly. During that time I kept trying to change the subject. No one else spoke up or indicated if they were angry/upset with anything she said so I thought it wasn’t a big deal. Also to add to this, everyone had a few drinks in them at that point.

Party ends and it’s late so everyone heads home. I pulled B aside and privately told her not to bring up the stuff with A around everyone as they are pretty close with him and it’s kind of uncomfortable. She apologized profusely and agreed. I figured all is well. Sent messages thanking everyone for the night and I went to bed.

A few days later I get a message from A telling me how he heard B and I were gossiping like high schoolers about him at the dinner. He told me how hurt he was and how he cried that night when he heard. I apologized, but also said the information he got was wrong. Everyone then agreed I wasn’t gossiping, but said they were mad I didn’t speak up for A. I asked why I was getting all the blame when anyone else at the table could have said something to B if they felt she was out of line. A says because B is MY friend and was MY guest at my birthday party that I am responsible for calling her out. I told him that I am not responsible for the way another adult acts and that, again, I did talk with her privately afterwards and took a more passive approach because I just wanted to enjoy my party. He also blamed me for their date going wrong because I gave him advice that had nothing to do with why B didn’t click with him. In the end, it didn’t matter what I said. He told me off and said he doesn’t have time for drama. My other friend cut me off as well.

They dismissed any point I tried to make and didn’t even try to consider my feelings. We never fought like this before. The punishment doesn’t seem to fit the crime. Am I responsible for B just because she is my friend?

I admit that maybe I should have been more vocal that night in telling B to be quiet, but I selfishly just wanted to avoid drama and focus on my birthday and having fun.

Those are my reasons for my interest in getting into a sport, but my parents has always refused to sign up and I would always stay patient. They've always told me that I should focus on my future career the most, that they don't have enough money, and because I'm a girl.

I yelled at them about it was unfair that my brother got more opportunities simply because he was a boy AND that he gets an extra addition of going to the gym, and that they have no right of saying they have no money if they pay for his fees (mind you his fee for swimming and the gym is around 160 dollars per month). I also started mocking them by acting like my mom and saying that my head hurts after blowing up. They started yelling at me back, telling me that I have no right to yell at them like that and that I genuinely make their heads hurt, and that they'll use their money however they like because they're the ones earning it. My other relatives have been laughing at me for wanting to joining sports due to my lack of physical strength, while others call me spoiled for yelling at my parents about it.

"ejt8cv","1578120777","AITA for not telling my wife about a party I had in our basement?","I'm 29, she is 28. My wife had been away visiting her parents for the past 5 days. One night, around 7, I decided to invite a few friends over to our basement. The basement is a great place to hang out in general and we often throw parties there. 

&#x200B;

At around 9:30 I just decided, screw it, lets invite a bunch of friends and throw a little party. About 15-20 people came to the basement and we had a party. Me and my wife casually do this a lot, invite a bunch of people over for a party. I didn't assume it was a big deal. Nobody ever goes upstairs, everything is contained to the basement. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, wife came back 2 days after. Everything was fine and dandy, I didn't even think to tell her about the party because again, I didn't think it was a big deal, and she was already stressed about her parents so I didn't care to tell her about anything here. Then she looked in the garbage outside and saw about a hundred beer cans in there and a bunch of bottles of liquor. She asked me what it was, and I mentioned I had thrown a party in the basement two nights before. She right away got insanely mad at me. Like ""YOU THREW A PARTY IN OUR HOUSE AND DIDNT EVEN TELL ME!!?"" kind of mad. I just told her I was sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal. Then she started getting accusational and asked me why I was throwing an entire party and not telling her, as if I was hiding something. We got over the fight quite a while ago, but I still think about it a lot. 

&#x200B;

If this was actually in the house, like on the first and second floor, that is a big deal. But our basement is just sort of empty except for a couch, a TV, a stationary bike, a punching bag, some boxes with useless shit in them, a tiny bathroom, and... that's really it. Its a huge basement, 90% of it is just empty. There is practically nothing to destroy or even make a mess of. Not to mention we've thrown like 15 parties in the basement before in the past 5 years we've been living here.

"ejtbwk","1578121387","AITA for not adopting my nephew?","Some background: Me (28/M) and my boyfriend (30/M) have been together for 8 years. We both have very good jobs and make a lot of money between the two of us. We're childfree, not the kind who call kids ""fuck trophies"" but we don't like kids and don't want kids. We also admittedly live kind of a party lifestyle. We go out to clubs a lot, drink, do drugs. We have an open relationship. Not exactly the kinda lifestyle a kid should be around. I have two sisters, Sarah and Rebecca. Sarah has a little boy, he's two, and she's raised him on her own since he was born. The father is completely out of the picture. Besides me, my family isn't exactly well-off. Sarah never finished high school and struggled financially. My parents are both on disability and live in a small apartment. Rebecca is attending university on a full scholarship.

During the holidays, Sarah was killed by a drunk driver. It's been very hard on our family especially with her kid in the mix. If none of us adopt him, he'll be going into foster care. My parents physically and financially can't take care of a young child and my other sister isn't exactly in the position to do so either, being a 20 year old uni student.

However, apparently, my parents and Rebecca all decided on behalf of me and my boyfriend that we'll be adopting him. Our immediate reaction was hell no, are you crazy? We have no desire to turn our lives upside down to take care of a kid, even if he's our nephew.

My parents and sister think we're being completely selfish and irrational and to say they're pissed would be an understatement. They can't believe we're going to let him go into foster care (their words). They know we make enough money to give him a good home and think we should just cut out the partying to become parents.

Rebecca was texting me this morning, essentially saying that lots people aren't ready to become parents when they get pregnant but they do it anyway. She also compared us to ""childfree guys who get their girlfriends pregnant and then leave her with the full responsibility when she doesn't get an abortion.""

I said that's fucking ridiculous because we aren't out here having the kind of sex that's going to result in anyone getting pregnant. We're perfectly content with the life that we live. She says we're terrible people if we don't give that little boy a good home when she ""knows"" that we could.

I think my family has lost their damn minds thinking we'd be good parents.

We've already made our decision regardless, but I do wanna know what Reddit thinks.

**edit**: I've been reading all of your comments and appreciate every one, even the ones calling me an asshole. A few things I do want to address:

\- I've seen a lot of comments saying I come across as an asshole or lacking empathy for the people in my family. That wasn't my intention, I'm not the best at conveying emotion through text (I'm on the spectrum) and I just wanted to lay out all the facts. I don't look ""down"" on anyone in my family for having less money than us, it's just the reason that they turned to me and my bf as the one who should take on the responsibility of our nephew which is why I mentioned it. We often helped Sarah out with things like rent and groceries when she was struggling. We essentially pay for my parents rent. I was very on edge when writing this post, my boyfriend and I had just fought over it too. I'm also very much still grieving my sister. None of this has been easy and I don't process things like this well.

\- I think I understated how busy our life is. I focused on mentioning the partying and drugs because it's a big factor in why I don't think it's appropriate for us to be raising a child. Not to mention the fact that neither of us like kids. But my job requires me to travel a fair amount (approx \~9 times a year, usually gone a week) and I work long shift. My boyfriend works a lot of late hours. We aren't home often. Even when we're not working, we're usually out of the house with friends. Taking a child in would literally mean changing our entire lives.

\- When I said over the holidays, I didn't necessarily mean this happened over New Years. This happened sometime in December which is as specific as I'd like to be.

\- I wasn't looking for ""validation"". I genuinely couldn't tell if my family was being absurd or if we were. The answers here seemed mixed. 

\- I saw one person call me a drug addict but there may have been more comments like that that I didn't notice. I will say that my bf and I aren't addicts, but I guess most addicts aren't going to admit that they are either. We smoke weed daily and occasionally do cocaine and ecstasy. We've dabbled in shrooms and acid. We drink when we go out. We aren't dependent on these things and have our life together otherwise. Bills are paid, we go to work sober, etc. We aren't having drug-fuelled orgies in our house with a bunch of heroin needles laying around. That seems to be the impression some people got.

With all that being said, we all got together earlier today to discuss some potential solutions. I hadn't mentioned extended family originally because we aren't a very close family. I don't really see my cousins or aunts, ever. Neither did Sarah. I know who the father of my nephew is and I've reached out to him. I'm not very hopeful that he'll even respond but it's worth a shot. A cousin of mine has also offered to take him in if need be, though her life is also quite hectic and I'm not sure if this will pan out. She lives on the other side of the country. I've offered to help out financially to whoever takes him in, but my boyfriend and I have still made our decision not to adopt him ourselves. 

Oh and no, my family isn't going to stop talking to me over this.

Lastly, thank you for all your input, especially the people who messaged me privately. I didn't answer everyone but you all gave me a lot of good advice and things to think about.","1578182206.0","Not the A-hole","288","305"

It was normal sibling rivalry stuff nothing terrible and we both did it to each other. As an adult I realized that I only was that mean to her because my parents clearly prioritized her over me. I knew it wasn't her fault she was the favorite so I also realized what a shit head I was. Tried to reconcile several times even took the blame for things I didn't do hoping she might forgive me. She never let any of this petty shit go and continued to resent me. I realized I can't make her forgive me so I just let her go on with her life and left her alone. She had a kid I wasn't allowed to see (despite asking to) for no reason she'd ever tell me. Wasn't even invited to her wedding. Okay whatever. 

About two years pass and my mom drops the bomb on me that when my niece was a baby she had cancer. She's fine now, in remission good prognosis, all of that. It was scary to hear that despite the fact I'd never even met my niece and had been outcast from getting near her but I still cared because she is my niece. Eventually this came up in a discussion with my sister (she wasn't there when I was told niece had cancer) and she flips out on me saying ""This is why I didn't tell you I knew you'd make it all about you and not me and how much pain I was in."" Everyone else is acting like I'm wrong for being curious. Keep in mind I'm not angry I wasn't told, not at all. I am hurt and confused but I was never angry.

"ejtopl","1578123669","AITA For Blocking My Mother For Calling Me A Future Murderer?","Okay, so context is definitely needed. I'm not planning on committing any felonies any time in my life. I actually plan on joining the military here soon, the USAF specifically. I know my parents have strong feelings against the military, but the few times they ever told me their stories about why were in really bad years for me, so I've let most of those memories fade. About 4 months ago, I started getting messages and emails from Recruiters do to my ASVAB (I think that's the acronym) score of 81, and at first I was annoyed because of what my parents instilled in me. But luckily for me, they also taught me to get both sides of the argument, something they're pissed about teaching me because now I am usually not on their side, so I decided to meet with one of them, to humour them.

It was a Marines recruiter, and (maybe not) surprisingly, the benefits did sound amazing, and I originally was going to enroll there, though eventually decided against it since I found out some stuff new to me about when exiting the military and that branch itself, finding the Air Force much more helpful. Since I'm usually pretty busy, it took about a month and a half down the road before I tell my parents about what's been happening, though it's not exactly like I need their permission. I knew they were going to be upset, but I had no idea just how pissed they actually would be, and none of their anger was even directed at how long it took. It was all about me being a failure because I wanted to join the military.

After a straight week of radio silence from both my parents, the longest they have ever gone without uttering a word to me, I decided the best thing for my mental health was to block them and keep them out of my life. Though, the very next day, I get my SSM's, Messenger, and Insta flooded with messages from my father's accounts, sent from both from dad and mom, ordering me to unblock them as soon as I read it. This was honestly the first time I ever stood up for myself and who I wanted to be, something they always wanted to see in me, as long as I sided with them. About an hour into the conversation, my mom drops the little gem on me of saying that ""being a future murderer is no way to find yourself"". To be completely honest, I lost my cool at that point. After everything they had ever dished out to me, I still only ever wanted to make my mother happy, but they only got more and more sour as time went on and I grew up, so I just kinda gave up on that idea at that point. I had to stop messaging them in totality for a while.

(There's more to the story, but I can't fit it into the 3000 character limit, and it's mostly just about my father)

"ejtp0h","1578123731","AITA for being upset about surprise ADULT dog tooth extractions at a teeth cleaning?","The other thread on surprise dog teeth removal made me want to ask this. It happened a few years ago.

I scheduled a tooth cleaning with my vet for my 3 year old dog. No papers were given to sign at all that I remember, and no mention at all was made that any teeth might be removed, and the vet had said the teeth looked nice. In fact, I was worried about my dog being ""put under"" for the procedure and the vet had said his teeth were clean enough that he could just do partial anaesthesia where he's groggy but not completely asleep, since he was a very gentle dog anyway so she wasn't worried about him biting or anything.

When I came to pick him up, same scenario as the other op guy pretty much. The woman who brought my dog to me said he'd had THREE teeth removed during the cleaning, including one of the very noticeable front teeth! I was enraged! I pitched a fit and the vet was never got because she was ""in surgery"". They tried to explain it to me but couldn't explain why no one had ever mentioned there was even the possibility any of his teeth might be removed during a routine teeth cleaning without even trying to consult me. I was even more enraged that they did it to him while he was AWAKE since we'd opted to do the ""groggy"" teeth cleaning instead of the fully asleep version. It's years past now and I'm still mad thinking about it.

Everyone at the vet acted like I was overreacting and it was a completely normal thing to do, and though no one said it I felt like they all thought I was an asshole. I've told others over the years and some agreed with me while others said the vet did what they thought was best and I was an asshole for making such a scene.

About a day or so ago I was given a heads up by my cousin (23 F) that she'd be having a small get together in our home town for her birthday. Her and I have always been very close and she practically begged and pleaded that I'd be there, since I haven't visited in a while. (It's about a 2-3 hour drive from where im currently located) so I get all dressed up , nothing too crazy and I head out 8AM. Whilst at the get together there were lots of our family and a few of her college friends. I noticed there was one friend of hers that was CONSTANTLY STARING AT ME. I mean not like glances here and there but staring daggers into my soul. I let my cousin know what was going on and she kindly introduced us... 
C is cousin, CF is Cousins friend, Me is me. 


Cousin: Hey CF! This is my little cousin op. 

Me: hey!  im only younger by 3 years lol. 

CF: oh hey! Very nice to meet you Op. I have to say you look beautiful in that skirt. Really makes your curves stand out. 

Me: uhh.. Thanks? How long have you and my cousin been friends? 

I was just saying anything to avoid that really awkward compliment. 

(Also I had a long sleeved back shirt on and a knee length gold skirt nothing provocative) 

Now at this point I kinda brush it off because I take it as him just being overly nice. I thank him and we continue with basic pleasant chit chat. It wasn't until he started getting a lot friendlier than i enjoyed. Little actions like touching my leg as we spoke (we sat next to each other in her living room with guests standing around) and basically playing footsies with me. Each little antic I continued to curve. He'd bring up wanting to be married and have children and just random things that had nothing to do with our general conversation. It wasn't until he attempted to pull that bs ""yawn and arm around her shoulder"" move that set me off. I kindly but firmly let him know that I was uncomfortable and that I am currently in a relationship (my boyfriend and I celebrate our 1 year anniversary in 2 days! 💚). He proceeded to act hurt and be upset, then stormed out of my cousins place in a huff. It was VERY dramatic and everyone saw him practically RUN out of the door. Cousin asked me what had happened and I explained I was feeling very uncomfortable and let CF know that, resulting in the reaction we all just witnessed. She said she'd never known him to be that way and it almost feels like she didn't even believe me..

It’s my 2nd dream city/location (Italy was the first, my exbf fucked that trip up tho so go figure). Last Friday I made an impromptu idea to book a flight to NYC for New Years and then stay until the following Sunday. My best friend(?) got tickets to go to New York and see a concert for Christmas. I got in contact with our mutual friend who already lives in New York and who my best friend was supposed to stay with and planned a whole surprise with her.

I get here and initially everything is fine until our mutual friends mother(has an alcohol problem apparently) comes to pick us up and she had been drinking. We both freak out and decide to book a room in a hotel in the city. All throughout the booking process I am checking and double checking with her to make sure this is still what we want and that she’s still down. She gives the okay every single time so I book the room and pay for it($400). 

Here’s where problems start: come time to check in she tells me she won’t be coming because she doesn’t want to wake up early to check in and she’s tired. I start getting frustrated because now I have to figure out how to get to the city by myself from Staten Island and I’m going alone.The plan was for me to go check in and wait for them to come into the city so we could hangout before our reservations for a show later that night. I wait until 3-4pm and they never show up to hangout.They show up for our reservations though and I’m frustrated but I don’t say anything because so am still trying to have a good time. After the show she tells me nonchalantly that she’s changed her mind and she’s not going to be staying at the hotel. She knew this the day before and the morning of the show and didn’t tell me or text me nothing. No heads up. 

She texts me tonight(after making plans and ditching me) that’s **she’s disappointed and frustrated with ME for not spending more time with her while we are in New York**. I went off on her a bit because I’m not alienating myself. She agreed to the hotel room with me, didn’t even have the decency to tell me she was flaking until it was way too late leaving me stranded in the city because if I cancel I lose a good bit of money and I don’t sleep here I waste my money(had to call her to get her to say a resemblance of sorry for this)She’s made vague plans to come hangout with me in the city and couldn’t even be bothered to cancel them or bother to check in on me once. Her reasoning for her actions or lack off is that she didn’t think anything of it because I am so independent that she thought I would love being out alone in this huge scary ass city by myself during my first time. So AITA for ending our almost 3 years of friendship over this?

**Edit**: clarifying that the trip was a surprise for her too and before I booked my ticket I was in contact with ones planning it who were passing down her words verbatim about inviting me to the trip but being scared I wouldn’t be able to afford it.

**another edit**: I’m not upset because she’s not spending time with me. I was never planning on messing with whatever she had planned at all. As soon as i knew i would be in the city for most of my time i downloaded bumble bff and was making plans to go explore with other girls in manhattan. Surprising her was nice lol but being in NYC was the main event. What upsets me is the lack of respect and just common decency that comes with the hotel situation and making plans with me(which means i reschedule my plans) only to not have the decency to even cancel so that I can go on with my day and then get upset with me for not hanging out enough.","1578130806.0","Not the A-hole","14","26"
"ejtsti","1578124425","WIBTA for cutting a friend out of my life?","English isn’t my native language. 

Me (F 17) and  W (F 17) have been friends since 8 years. We’ve been together in a class since grade 5 till grade 10.( Different school system)

In my country school is over after grade 10 and you can choose to continue school till grade 12/13, to further educate yourself and be able to attend university afterwards. 

I applied to a school which accepted me right away. While W applied to multiple schools except mine and didn’t got accepted. I suggested her to apply to my school which she declined saying it’s a bad school and only bad students are there.I thought it was a Great School and yeah it is. 

To give some backstory I couldn’t attend grade 9 because I suddenly developed extreme anxiety and depression but I went to therapy and got much better. 
Nowadays I’m doing great, I still have little issues with panic sometimes which I can handle well. W knows that. During 10th grade Ws Mother died and she was in deep sorrow, we all did our best to support her and I suggested to go into therapy to handle her grief and to move on with her life but she declined. She took a 2 week break from school but seemed to do fine afterwards. I was always there for her and listened when her sorrow took her over. 

Now here is the problem. 

While I started grade 11 , W stayed home the entire year. During that time she told me that her anxiety is so bad that she can’t even go outside. I suggested her to go therapy like I did because it helped me a lot , she agreed to it but when I asked her a day later she said she changed her mind. This went on for an entire year. And I can’t lie, I got sick of it.

I even got her a appointment at my therapist and everyone who ever had to deal with something like this knows how hard it is to get a appointment at a therapist. But W didn’t even attend the appointments the therapist gave her after the first meeting. She told me the therapist didn’t have time for her, which I know isn’t true. So she lied to me about that. 

She got meds for her anxiety and complained to me that she still got panic attacks. I told her ofc, If you don’t do real therapy, the meds have no use. They are to stabilize the client so that they are ready for a therapy.  Which she said wasn’t true. 

Nowadays I’m in grade 12 about to graduate in April. W is now in grade 11 at my school despite saying last year that it’s a bad school. Now W sometimes ask me to talk to her during breaks. She keeps complains about her anxiety, that her life sucks and I offer to help her but she declines. 

I’m honestly sick of this. I slowly feel like she doesn’t even want help and I don’t have any nerves for this anymore. She answers my text only when she needs to complain about her own problems which could have been solved already. I don’t mind helping but she clearly doesn’t want help, she just wants to complain about life without confronting her problems.

But she's old and alone and while I try to keep in touch, she keeps trying to take advantage of me. AITA for keeping contact to a bare minimum?

INFO:

Me and my mother have never been close. She was very neglectful and abusive of me as a child, and after my father died when I was 12 she used me as an emotional punching bag. Then she started dating- and her first boyfriend was 9 years older than me (she was 40 at the time).

She's always been very selfish. She projected her own weight issues on me and caused me to have low self esteem and eating disorders, and just told me on a couple of occasions her boyfriend was more important than I was. As a teenager she neglected me, and when I got in trouble at school she decided the best thing she could do was shame me in front of all the family for having bulimia (eating then throwing up because she told me I was fat. I wasn't, I was just tall and well built and growing).

I could not live or do anything with my life with her around, she always brought me down. So I left. Left the country, and made a life for myself abroad. It was hard, I had to do a bunch of shitty jobs while I put myself through university and get the career I wanted. I'm OK and successful in my career now after 20 years of hard work, but I am still struggling with the issues she inflicted on me- I have severe trust and abandonment issues and I still struggle with my weight sometimes.

She is now in her 70s and retired.  She isn't doing bad, her pension is comfortable and i help her occasionally, but she constantly tries to emotionally blackmail me for money because she thinks everybody in the West is rich. Every time I call her she's just... unbelievably obtuse because she doesn't understand my problems, and it always leaves me frustrated and angry.

I have been trying to cut down contact with her to the minimum because it's stressing me out, but I feel guilty.

One phonecall a week is all I'm willing to give her but she complains that she's lonely and ""will die soon"".

She never apologized for neglecting me as a child or emotionally abusing me as a teenager. She doesn't even admit doing it. I'm at the point where I don't want to even go home anymore because spending time with her makes me very miserable.

Disappointed but understanding, I had to commission another artist for replacement art as I needed it. I offered a copy of the model to the artist as thanks for the small bit she did, and asked permission to sell the model publicly as I needed the money. She said I could sell it. I asked if I needed to alter it to sell, and she said that the model was completely mine and I could do as I wish. 

A week later she gave me a “completed” part of her trade, though the second piece of art was nowhere near the quality of the first part and I told her that I already was in the process of getting another commission, and I do not feel like the art trade was honored. She said that was fine and she was sorry still. 

I held onto the model for a bit, not putting it immediately to sale since I got overloaded with work. Finally I had a break last month so I asked again to double check permission to sell, and she said it was fine. 

I finally put it for sale and someone commissioned me to make a similar model with different features and colors. 

She (the original art trade artist) messaged me out of the blue saying that she is uncomfortable with the changes to the model, and wants me to halt all sales of the original and the alterations. She also added that she would now be fine with sales of the models if she received royalties from them.

I told her that this was not our previous agreement, and I will be honoring what was agreed upon. I include credit to the original concept (her character) with the purchase of the model. I intend to keep selling the model.


TL;dr: I made a 3D model of an artist’s character and she gave me complete permission to sell it. Now that it’s being sold, she is asking for royalties even though it wasn’t agreed upon. Am I the asshole for following previous agreements?","False","Not the A-hole","53","35"

This has worked for almost 12 years now and I'm 21 and she's 19, we have moved out but we live together cause we goto colleges near each other and we've always been pretty close.  Recently I put the ""marks"" on a couple pieces of clothing that I was planning on wearing for a date.  I get home after my classes and go to the closet and she broke the rules, call it dumb but this has worked for 12 years and has stopped so many fights and she just straight up broke it.  I was able to get a back up dress ready and the date went well but I was annoyed that she broke such a long standing tradition.  I told her that I'm kinda mad that she did that and that I don't trust her anymore.  She apologized but she ""needed"" it.  I told her that I needed it too and that it was mine.  I wouldn't say we were fighting just having a discussion.

The next day she did it AGAIN and broke our rule and took a couple shirts I marked.  This time I was pissed and told her our rule of borrowing clothes will be broken if she takes one of my marked clothes again

Yesterday I caught her wearing my tube top that cost me a lot of money that id NEVER let her wear and it was marked, not to dig on her but she's not the most delicate person and breaks shit very often.  I basically forced her to take it off cause I didn't want to risk her ripping it (we are the same size but she would do something stupid and wreck it).  She took it off after some back and forth but she was pissed.

I had enough and said to not touch my shit and how our rule is over.  She isn't allowed to touch any of my clothes period and Ive started to lock my door so she can't and I don't touch any of her stuff either of course.

"ejuf0p","1578128809","AITA for talking back to my sister at work?","Some backstory:
I've worked part-time at a local burger shop on and off for the past two years. A couple months ago, the assistant manager was fired and the branch manager wanted to promote me but that would mean coming on full-time (which I can't do because of my other job) so I instead suggested my sister for the position. At the time, she was making barely anything at an autoparts company and I thought this would be boost for her. I talked her up constantly to the manager and the owners and helped her with her resume amd what to say in interviews. I really wanted this to work out well for her. 

She did not get off to a good start. She didn't even know that she wad applying for assistant manager until after her first interview because she didn't read my texts about the position. Also, she constantly dissappears and leaves the staff hanging so she can go do whatever. This has been brought up by several other staff members to the branch manager and to me. My manager has asked me about it several times and I've always covered for my sister. 

Last night was one of our busiest nights of the week and we were slammed. I was running all over the place (taking/running orders, running drivethru, dishes,etc.) while my sister os taking apparent 5 minute breaks in the office every chance she can get. Needless to say, we were behind when we finallg did close. When closing time comes, she completely dissappears while my coworker and I are left to do all closing chores by ourselves. We spend the next couple of hours cleaning and stocking the restaurant without her help. She doesn't reappear until we are finally done, and then comes out and tells me that I hadn't mopped properly. 

I look at the what she is pointing out, but I don't see anyting so I ignore it. She keeps going on and asks if I' sure I mopped because the floors are dry. My coworker lets her know he saw me mop and I tell her it' s just dry because I had already mopped a while ago. I keep looking at the floor but there's no stains. She then tells me that she doesn't think I mopped well enough and wants me to do it again. My patience finally snaps. I tell her that I already mopped the floors and that if she thinks I didn't do good enough, then she should mop. She says it's her neck on the line so I should do better but I say that I don't care because I already did my job while she was hiding doing god knows what. I then gather my things as I'm giving everything a once over and clock out. 

My coworker thinks I was a little harsh on her and told me I was being ""that guy."" My sister has already texted me and said she didn't appreciate the disrespect. I told her that I'm not happy with how tonight went either, which I am not. I don't like snapping on people, but tonight just got to me. It's incredibly frustrating for me to defend her when she's doing the exact behaviour everyone is accusing her of. And then, she comes at me after we did all of the work and she did nothing. 

So, am I the asshole?

EDIT:
Thank you everyone for your responses. After having given it more thought, I know that I should have handled myself better. I should have never have talked to her like that infront of my coworkers, but I am going to address the other issues with her before it becomes an even bigger problem for me. 
For those asking for more info, I recommended her for the position because she has prior management experience and she had been telling me that she needed a new job. I genuinely thought it would be a good fit and that it would help her out. As far as me defending her goes, she's my sister. It's my natural instinct to defend her.

Anyway I had surgery on my shoulder yesterday because of pain I’ve been having for two years from when I played lacrosse in high school (I’m 19 F). My parents went away for the weekend which is fine because all my siblings contributed to sending them away because I was supposed to have surgery earlier and be much more recovered by now (my surgeon had an accident and ironically needed shoulder surgery).

Anyway my sister (27 F) was in charge of basically just monitoring me but I was fine enough for her to run her errands and do some work in her classroom while I just relaxed at home. She called me when she was on her way home and asked me to order online from a nearby restaurant and she would pick it up (she gave me her order and card number). 

My brother (25 M) came home a little bit after my sister and asked where his food was. I hadn’t ordered any for him because he had texted me earlier basically insinuating he wouldn’t be home tonight at all and since he doesn’t like Chinese food I didn’t think it was a big deal especially since it was really my sister paying for food for us. But I told him there were a ton of leftovers in the fridge from New Years if he was hungry but he refused and said I should have gotten him something since I wasn’t eating leftovers. 

To be clear my brother works two jobs, one of which is typically just for petty cash while the other he uses to save up for a house and when our parents are gone we usually only get food for ourselves. He called my parents and my parents said that I should have called him to see if he wanted anything and now he’s insisting I should share the food my best friend is bringing over tomorrow (my sister can’t stay with me because she has plans with her husband) with him even though he refuses to watch me and make sure I take my medicine on time.

I, on the other hand, have a really hard time getting into a video game unless it's a video game I'm playing with someone else. I just have a difficult time staying focused on the game and sticking through to the end on my own.  

This is something that honestly annoys me. There are so many games I want to play, but I often start games and then just can't stick with them. This typically happens because of plot spoilers or backseat gaming, or because I just get caught up in something else and can't get back into the game.

Also, my boyfriend and I both have our PS4s in the living room, so sometimes it's really difficult to avoid the backseat gaming / spoilers since most of the games I play are games he's recommended to me. Or we'll start a game together and because he has a lot more free time and prefers to spend more of his time gaming, he'll progress farther ahead than me, and unintentionally spoil the game for me, and I'll usually just stop playing the game after that. That's not really fair to him, but that's what happens. The game just isn't as fun for me anymore.

Anyway, the other day my boyfriend and I went to GameStop to spend some of our Christmas money. I find a game called Hellblade and decide to buy it. My boyfriend ends up buying 3 or 4 games that he wants to play.

I started playing Hellblade today (my boyfriend watched a little) and so far I really like it. It's one of the few games I've found in the past like 4 or 5 years that I could actually see myself finishing. It's new to me and my boyfriend hasn't played it, so I have 0 spoilers or expectations going in. I feel like I can make up my own mind about whether or not I like it. And the story and gameplay are both great so far.

After I told my boyfriend how much I was liking the game, he decided he wanted to play it as well, but I ended up asking him not to play it until after I'd finished it. We got into a big fight about it because he thought it was unfair of me to ask him to wait. 

I felt like if he played it as well, and progressed further ahead than me, then I'd have the game spoiled for me, especially since we're both in the same room playing the game. I want the chance to actually finish the game.

I can understand his side, I suppose. He wants to play the game and even though I'm the one who bought it and he has plenty of other games, he feels he has the right to play it when he wants to. (I do have pretty much unlimited access to all of his games.) And he had a point when he said that it might be a long time before I actually finish it, if ever...

So we are not on proper terms right now. Until she found out that she was pregnant. To which I suggested visiting a doctor for confirmation, I most definitely wore condoms every-time we had sex.

He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.

My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.

Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.

Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).

edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?

There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.

Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.

This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. 

Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart.

Walking was out of the question and i had money concerns (she was aware of) she offered that we drive there and leave a car then taxi back so we could have some drinks while enjoying the band. This made me uncomfortable as fare would be pricey.
When we checked into camp site, i enquired about shuttles. They knew there was a girl on site that was going to the same gig so introduced us.
Yes she was going, would drive and we could get a lift each way. Perfect 
We get to the gig, 2 of us get drinks and order pizzas for us all. I start feeling unwell though. We go into gig and get another drink. I have half (total of 1.5 standard drinks) By this point I’m having heat waves feeling really nauseated.

I make my way to bathroom. I cross the room, swaying and dizzy – I feel so unwell. There’s a queue so I’m kneeling on the floor in a venue bathroom!

She suggests i sit in the car. I end up uncomfortably asking this women( just met) if i can sit in her car for abit. She was reluctant so I suggest she take her keys. She agrees and found me a towel to warm me. 
Recap, arrived at gig 7pm, dinner and 1 drink by 730pm, woozy and sick by 830. Camp 8kms+ away and money tight. In car by 930pm before the band I’d bought the tickets for had even started to play.
I vomit over fence, sit in car, head pounding and freezing. 
Midnight hoards of people left venue  past our car 2min walk as band finished. No sign of them
Wait another half hour and text “how long you guys gonna be”
Half hour later
“We’re just having a couple of staffies. Do you want to go.”
”yes”
Half hour later, the women came running to the car saying “she just keeps going, i can’t believe she left you out here even after you texted her, i came as soon as I knew “
She drove me back to camp alone
Friend got in round 3 or 4.
In the morning I woke round 6, laid there awake due to her snoring and me being unwell
Round 8am asks how im feeling. I respond
 “like garbage, please get up i would like to leave”
It was my tent. We packed camp with moments of me sitting on ground to get tent pegs as i was so weak. 
About to get into the car, she says
 “like usual we have a good time then you pack a shit”
“you left me sick and freezing in a car while you had staffies, it’s so SELFISH”
She started yelling but I don’t know what she said as i got in my car and drove away.

We both have very good jobs here and generally we live quite comfortable lives.

A few weeks ago we found out that she was pregnant with twins and we were both thrilled. We decided that since we were visiting my family in the US over winter break, it would make sense to tell them then. 

When I brought up the subject earlier today at dinner, my family was obviously excited for us. However they were immediately curious about how/where we planned to raise them. I explained that since we both had great careers, and that we lived fine lives in China, we planned to raise them there.

Both of my parents were very shocked and started arguing with me, saying that I was robbing them of their grandchildren.

I continued to try and explain but they both seemed to be absolutely devestated. The rest of our dinner was mostly silent.

Later that night, my sister angrily texted me saying I was an asshole for ruining their ""hopes of having grandchildren"" and etc. I tried to calmly explain my side again but it was to no avail.

My parents are covering my college costs so I could go through school debt-free. They are generously paying 1k a semester, the rest is covered in scholarships. I am so grateful for the chance to further my education without student loans. For two years, thanks to good grades, I got to live on campus, this increased the cost to 5k a semester. After some miscommunications and missing the deadline, I didn't register for dorms for my third year and moved back home. Its a drive but I can get to school as long as I leave early. Since I am still not paying for anything, I do my best to help out with the chores, the pets, anything they ask of me, I try to make happen.  
Coming back home revealed my Dad did not grow out of a bad habit. As long as he is home, it is 'family time'.   


This means we sit in the living room and watch whatever he wants to for 6-12 hours, conspiracy shows or sports, take your pick. My Mom usually is allowed to go out and garden, only after my Dad makes comments about how much he hates her not spending time 'relaxing' with him (reading, cooking, on facebook, or napping in the same room, never another room or he gets upset). I try to spend as much time upstairs in my room as possible in the morning before coming downstairs, pretending I am asleep so I can just relax without someone breathing down my neck. That is, if he doesn't text me over and over and or come upstairs to actually see if I am awake or not.

Once I am downstairs, family time begins and you are not to leave the room. If I get up to use the restroom, he will text me multiple times asking where I went. I need to clear it with him if I just want to leave the house to visit a friend or even go get something from my room. If I am on my phone too much while its 'family time' he gets upset since I am not paying attention to how aliens made the pyramids. If I try to leave without clearing anything with him, my Dad gets upset and complains we are only using him for money. It's gotten harder since I am trying to do freelance work, 2 hours, twice a week, it's not very much, but I enjoy it. Yet, the moment he gets home its constant texts about where am I, can't I come rub his feet/massage his back, can't I spent more time with him. It isn't that I don't want to but its so unenjoyable that it drains me.

I can't even leave the room to do homework without talking to him first and I still getting texted constantly. I just want to spend time with my friends, play games with friends, be a better student, etc. This is even a throwaway because so far he has found and followed me on every single social media account I have to make sure I am being a 'good girl' on social media... I just want to exist in my own world.

Both of my parents were married multiple times with multiple children and my only full sibling and I(22F) (who we’ll call James(20M)) are from their final marriages.

My dad has 2 older sons (John and Joe) from his first wife who I’ve met a handful a times and who are quite a bit older than either of us (at least 12 years)

They lived with us (James, my parents and I) briefly when I was too young to remember but aside from that I have met John 3 times and Joe twice that I recall (once at his wedding, when I was 12, the only person I knew was my dad, and I was not included in the “family seating” so was very uncomfortable the whole time). They otherwise lived in a different part of the country near the rest of my father’s family. They both also seem to be exhaustingly self absorbed and narcissistic. John has been in legal trouble multiple times since he was a teen.

The last time I met them was when dad passed, when I was 14 and James was 12, and they essentially came to collect all of his belongings and the majority of his ashes. The only things returned to us from the possessions they retrieved from his house were two of our large collection of baseball bats, because John graciously told us “if you want to pick one each to keep that’s alright with me”

After that they vaguely tried to keep in contact, telling us every couple years or so we should convince our mom to “send us to visit them” in another province (keeping in mind mom was single with two teenagers and they were adults with careers who wanted her to foot the bill)

When James graduated a few years ago he invited Joe to celebrate with him, but when they learned they wouldn’t be able to attend the actual ceremony due to shortage of tickets, they changed their minds last minute.

John invited me to his wedding a few years ago and while I originally planned to go, between some things he posted on Facebook in the meantime and the fact that it would have been exorbitantly expensive with travel and accommodation, I opted out.

Ended up very glad I did because he literally didn’t notice that I wasn’t there (messaged me after to say “sorry I didn’t get a chance to talk to you at all at the wedding”)

Anyway I’ve recently deleted them both off of Facebook due to Joe being for the most part a vapid egomaniac, and John posting things that vary from slightly ignorant to outright bigoted.

And I’ve come under a certain amount of fire for that and for just referring to them as “my dad’s older sons” because blood is thicker than water and all that.

Her parents are in the financial advising/insurance sales/accounting industry, and GF (in college heading for med school) has been slowly immersed into their fields as well.

GF's parents place of work has a culture of bringing in close friends of employees as clients (being an MLM), and GFs parents have invited me to many of their ""work parties"" which mostly boil down to a sales presentation for non-employee guests. Her parents have attempted to contact my father, a recent retiree, offering to help him with his retirement plan (as an official client). He declined, having already consulted his own FA, and avoided their attempted future contact regarding the matter. GF's father often tries to get me on board with the business, telling me how he could get me an opportunity in the company (despite me having an bachelor's degree in a completely unrelated field). This being my GF's parents, I show passing interest in the subject of the conversation when it arises, but otherwise decline any further involvement. I've made GF aware on many, many occasions as to my apprehension regarding her family pushing both her and I into their business, but she doesn't see the fault, and is willingly ramping up into higher positions within the organization by taking license tests and other similar preparation.

As of late, GF's mother has been making pushes to give me ""advice"" on savings or investment strategies. My understanding of their company is their main profits are made not by selling the advising services, but that the income is from commissions and referrals to external companies. The idea of being a customer of GF's parents' financial management business is something I am very hesitant to approach, lest some business disagreement affect their perception of me as their daughter's partner. GF says she thinks my first impression of the business is ""not very good"", and that I'm assuming the worst in not giving it a chance. She says she's asking for ""a little trust"" and says that it hurts that I won't even consider it. Before this, I had thought that doing business with your in-laws was something to be avoided, something that would potentially stress the personal and familial relationship, and that this was a common notion. During the long conversation I repeatedly asserted this as just being something I'm not comfortable with, and felt it was unfair that she was insisting on questioning my boundaries rather than respecting them. I really do value her opinion very much, however, and I'm very unsure as to the validity of my opinions at this point. I'm torn between asserting my personal ideologies and not wanting her to think I don't trust her family. I should mention that both she and her family are great people otherwise who I really get along with, and have no other qualms with.

Am I the asshole for trying to keep GF's family business at an arm's length, and am I the asshole for wanting her to respect my boundaries?

I apologised for being dramatic and my mom said sorry for not asking me first.
------


Nobody else in my family seem to think it's a big deal, but while I'm away at university my parents (specifically mom) decided that they were going to give my piano away.

The reasons for this are:
 - my brother (14M) wanting more space in that room (its basically his living room now, but it used to be both of ours)
 - my piano teacher has a student who doesn't have a piano so it's going to them

For the record, I'm happy that its going to a good home and if they asked me first I'd be a little sad but I'd still agree to give it away. However, they didn't ask or even tell me any of this; my brother randomly told me last night saying he thought I knew. I'm mad because this piano has been mine for almost a decade and I've had countless lessons on it. It's sentimental to me and I feel like my parents are treating it like some random junk that I don't care about.

All I wanted was an apology for not asking me first and my dad told me to get over it (wtf?)
It made me wonder if I'm being overdramatic and making a mountain over a molehill or if my parents are being assholes.

We dated for about a year when we were both 21. This is going to sound incredibly mean, but I broke up with her because she is a huge crybaby. She would cry over absolutely everything. She does it to shift blame or guilt from herself to other people. Im a naturally stoic and reserved individual and i keep my emotions locked down pretty tight. She would cry whenever I didn't talk to her in the car and instead preferred to sit in silence. She started crying when I would chastise her for running stop signs/other reckless driving habits. She would start sobbing uncontrollably and say im toxic for yelling at her over small things. Once she backed into my car and when I said ""dont worry about it, you have insurance"" she immediately broke down in tears. She would say things like ""why don't you love me?"" whenever she felt I wasnt being affectionate enough. I like her as a person, but I never signed up to be anybody's third parent. So I broke it off.
Since we broke up, shes beeb haphazardly jumping from one relationship to another. She can't stay single for more than a month. She dated a man who gave her an STD knowingly. She dated a single mom with three kids that would punch the wall when she got angry. She is now dating a random girl who lives six states away that she met on tiktok two weeks ago. Her dating habits remind me of a 13 year old weeb kid that is sucked into online forum relationships. She told me all she wants to do is get married.
I felt it was something a friend would do, to point out this unhealthy behavior. So i told her that she shouldnt be concerned with dating anybody and should focus on her mental health. I told her that her dating habits were immature and not the dating habits of a healthy 25 year old. 
She told me I need to mind my own business and that not everybody can be as cold and unfeeling as I am. However, at the inevitable fiery crash of each of her relationships, I'm the one she comes crawling to for advice and comfort.

They tell any and every embarrassing story from 10-15 years ago to achieve this. By now, I know all these stories, and they are only doing it to bother him and entertain themselves. 

Example- the first visit they ever made to our new home after we got married, they loudly asked me if I had heard the story yet about how he lost his virginity. 

Halfway into the visit, they started up again asking him if he remembered ""the dumbest thing he did in high school"" or something.  I jumped in and said that they're always bringing up these old stories that everyone has heard 10 times. They backpedaled and said they were just making conversation, and I blurted that it was a ""dumb ass conversation topic."" My mother in law became super quiet and my father in law tried to defend that it ""wasn't dumb ass,"" while my husband said my name in that ""you can't say that!"" type of way. 

I apologized about 10 minutes later and things seemed fine, but as soon as we left at the end of the week my mother in law was sending novels of texts to my husband about how disrespectful I am and essentially boiled down to: Control Your Woman and Pick My Side. 

I apologized a second time and also asked her not to blame him for my choices since I'm my own person.

During the summer I asked a friend of mine to be in my wedding party. The problem is he’s a pretty heavy drinker, and rarely is up past 7-8 in the evening because he can’t stay awake. I figured it wouldn’t be a problem and he’d take it easy on the day of the wedding and it wouldn’t be a problem. I also lent him $175 earlier in the year, and it took almost 5 months to get it back from him, even though he constantly had money for booze, smokes, etc. It was annoying but he was going through a rough patch with work and I didn’t need it. 

A few months later his wife said she wants a divorce and they are in the process of separating, so he gave me $400 to hold on to for things like renting a suit, shoes, hotel, and whatever else he would need because he said he probably won’t be able to afford it by the time of the wedding with the divorce going on and all the other expenses. Not long after, he started asking if he could borrow a bit of the money for things. He still always had money for smokes and booze, so I said no thats not what the money you asked me to hold onto is for. The second time he asked for it, he said it was really important, he wanted to take a girl out on a date and he needed a couple hundred bucks, and he would pay it back, and it was really important and if it meant he couldn’t be in the wedding party that was fine. 

At first I told him I’d give him some of the money on the condition that by the end of January he had it all paid back or he’d have to take it all back and come as a guest. I didn’t feel very good about it after because I could barely get him to pay back my own money when he wasn’t getting a divorce, and I had a pretty good feeling that there was no way he was gonna pay it back. Plus with his drinking I was starting to have doubts of his reliability to help out during the wedding, and him saying he was willing to not be in the party, and the fact that I have no interest in managing a 52 year olds money for him, I told him that I consider him to still be a really good friend, but I think it’s best for both of us if he just attended as a guest instead and he can have all his money back, and he won’t have any financial obligations, and in a month and I half he’d already asked for it back twice and I wasn’t going to manage his money for him and I wasn’t going to lend him any money if he couldn’t pay it back. 

He didn’t take it very well, and hasn’t responded to me in a month now, so he obviously didn’t mean it when he said he’d understand if he couldn’t be in the wedding party was wasn’t planning on me removing him. At first I felt like I shouldn’t feel bad because I have helped him out lots, and I don’t owe him anything and I have enough to worry about without worrying about him, but on the other hand I feel bad because he’s going through a lot already and I kicked a friend when he was down and may have ruined a friendship.

He's thirteen years older so I guess for a while he was the favorite, being the only child. He and his wife are incredibly obnoxious. They like to do things for my grandma like buying her nice items (TVs, electronics, furniture, etc) but then call my dad, me, my brother, and ask that we reimburse them because ""we (aunt and uncle) can afford them up-front but in the long-run we'd really like to recuperate the costs). They never let us know they're going to buy her an item until afterward which means we get hit with a surprise request for reimbursement. Nine times out ten we agree to pay up because in the end we love grandma and want her to have a good and happy life with nice things. 

Recently dad took a month off of work to fix grandma's house. It was falling apart. He really couldn't afford to take a month off but he did, and spent $30,000 of his savings on her. My brother and I did what we could but we're young adults just starting out so we couldn't offer much more than labor and encouragement.

Two weeks after he finished the house uncle and aunt showed up. They had bought grandma new, very expensive furniture and electronics. Uncle then took photos of the house and the new stuff, posted it on Facebook and claimed credit for everything. My dad got no mention. Several of our cousins and their childhood friends and family are on their FBs and they all commented on how good a son my uncle is, how grateful grandma must be to have such a loving child, how every child should be more like him. My dad was incredibly hurt but refused to sink to their level and publicly call uncle and aunt out. 

Recently grandma and dad's birthday came up (they share a birthday) and dad decided to throw grandma a surprise party. Grandma was so pleased and insisted dad share the party since he never celebrated. During the party I heard uncle and aunt claiming credit for the party. After years of watching dad take his undeserved knocks and shake 'em off I guess I snapped. I made a speech in which I thanked dad for the party, making sure to let everyone know that he and he alone was responsible for it, had no help, asked for nothing from no one, all for his mama. I also thanked him for the work he did on her house, also making sure everyone knew how much he sacrificed and did (without bringing money into it). Uncle and aunt stormed out after making a fuss.

"ejwfll","1578143217","AITA for wanting a sofa?","I live in a house with 5 other students and we have 2 sofas in the lounge. These two sofas were left here from the previous tenants and they’re pretty grimy, but functional. We put blankets on top of the so we don’t have to see the stains etc. 

I have a fairly big room in the house, and the agreement when we moved in was that I could have the big room, but as long as we can also use it as a social space sometimes. We haven’t been able to use it much as a social space because the only place to sit is either on my desk chair or my bed, hardly room for 6 people. 

I suggested that in the new year we all buy a new sofa for the downstairs and then move the grimy one into my room so that we can use my room more for movie nights or whatever. I suggested that we split the cost of the sofa 6 ways as it’s going to be downstairs and we will all use it, to which people got annoyed saying that I’m gaining a new sofa when they’re not. 

I understand their point, so I suggested that we split the sofa cost so that I pay DOUBLE what everyone else pays. For example, a £70 sofa will be £10 each for them and £20 for me. (I know sofas are more expensive than this but just for an easy example). I also suggested that we waited until everyone got their student loans and they’d have some money, and we can treat ourselves. 

I personally don’t get a student loan as I have a part time job and try and support myself off of that, so if I have to pay for a sofa it’ll come out of my wages which will be a bigger hit to me than them paying out of a £2k lump sum loan. 

At this stage I wondered if maybe they just didn’t want a new sofa, so I suggested that we don’t bother, and we then can’t use my room as a social space because we literally can’t seat everyone without people being sat on the floor. This is when shit hit the fan. 

My housemates then accused me of lying when I said that we could use my room as a social space, as a way of securing the big room. They then also suggested that because I have the big room, it should be my responsibility to ensure we can all relax in there, so they suggested I buy the new sofa myself. This wasn’t a bad idea and I said ‘ok sure I wouldn’t mind having a new sofa in my room’ to which they all started saying that I should put the new sofa *that I have to pay for* into the lounge, and the grimy one in my room. 

I said no and that I would want the new one in my room as I paid for it. My best mate then messaged me saying that other housemates have told him that they think I’m being a selfish asshole cos I’m not sharing a shiny new sofa, and I’m apparently ‘rubbing it in their faces’ that I can afford a sofa without a loan.

I was hanging out with Julie last night, and she said Brian had told her he was really hurt that I hadn't asked him to be part of the wedding. I did ask my fiance early on if he would consider making Brian a groomsman, and he declined because he said he'd prefer to have his own friends on his side, which is fair. 

I guess I could theoretically have made Brian a ""bridesman"" or whatnot, but that's not really traditional and it would look a little weird to have an extra guy on my side. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong by only asking my female friends to stand up with me.

While we were at dinner, we were talking about our relationships. We met our partners around the same time over a year ago. She told me that she and her partner decided to have an open relationship. Although the relationship is “open” he’s sleeping with people and she’s not. 

This guy is living at her house, not paying any bills *and* sleeping with other women? I told her that he was making her look like a plum fool, and that it might be the reason she’s feeling depressed and has low self esteem. 

She went off about how I’m uptight and judge mental about open relationships. She said that I didn’t have the confidence to share my partner. I told her that I surely don’t! And that she’s sharing her partner but he’s not sharing her. And maybe if she didn’t share her partner she wouldn’t call me and tell me how ugly she’s feeling, and how depressed she is.

Anyway, I was planning on having every food at my party be puréed. We’re also having mousse and ice cream instead of a regular cake.

Anyway, I was talking to a couple of my friends about my party. Most of them seemed fine with the food idea, but one of them asked a couple times if there really wasn’t going to be any “normal” food at the party and seemed a bit put off. Another friend also said it was weird.

A few days later another one of my friends also said it was weird. They asked if they could bring food from home and I told them I’d really prefer if they didn’t. They didn’t really protest that.

On my friends’ end, I see how it could definitely be off-putting and weird. Maybe even uncomfortable. But I really don’t want to be excluded from anything at my own birthday. So AITA?

"ejwlrc","1578144329","AITA for talking to my coworker for 50 mins instead of my boyfriend?","This got longer than I meant it to because I can’t be concise for shit, oof

I (19F) work the night shift at the desk at my school’s dorms. My bf (19M) usually stays up with me. I go on rounds and occasionally manage incidents, but I have most of the night to do whatever I want. Today was my first shift of the semester, the same day my bf drove back up to his college. He wanted to stay up with me for the whole night despite not sleeping during the day. I suggested multiple times to go to sleep soon, but he really wanted to spend the time with me so I didn’t press it. We went from seeing each other every 3 days or so to having to be separated and busy again so I get it and I’m glad for the company. 

At around 4:40am my bf and I are trying to play a game, when my supervisor (I’m also a supervisor, but we all work gen shifts too) comes by on campus rounds. Usually the leads talk with each staffer for 15-20 minutes, but it can go longer or shorter. We haven’t caught up in awhile, and there’s a lot to talk about regarding new semester work stuff, so the conversation lasts nearly 50 minutes. After the conversation finished I messaged bf saying she left, and shortly after I went on rounds. I figured he’d fallen asleep at that point since he didn’t respond. 

When my shift was almost over, bf woke up and messaged me. He felt really upset that he fell asleep and that we didn’t get to spend the last 2 hours of my shift together. Some of it seemed directed at me for prolonging the conversation with my lead, but the majority of it was at himself for falling asleep. I felt bad for letting the conversation go on so long when my bf was staying up after a long day just to spend time with me. I ignored one friend to talk to another and that’s a classic AH move. But I also value my relationship with my fellow leads and don’t want to put up barriers to conversations we would otherwise be having. I don’t resent him for feeling bad and recognize that it’s partially my fault, but I also recognize that he probably wouldn’t be reacting this strongly if he hadn’t been pushing himself to stay awake past reasonable levels. The guilt on both sides would’ve been avoided if he’d gone to sleep halfway through my shift. 

AITA here? I know I’m tired and blowing this way out of proportion for such a small issue, but I can’t help but feel both guilty and annoyed. I was hoping this sub could provide some perspective when my brain clearly isn’t in the state to do so.

EDIT: After we napped we talked about it, he clarified that he wasn’t upset that I was talking to my lead, I made a point to say that he should sleep when he needs it instead of being a valiant fool and staying up.

Sarah didn’t want to surf. We told her we’ll be out fairly deep waiting for some big waves. She said that’s fine. We all jumped in the water and out we paddled. Sarah stayed behind with water only up to her ankles. We’re having a blast, catching a few waves and getting wiped out every now and then.

We start pushing each other into oncoming waves, wrestling and talking crap for another hour or two. Every 15 minutes or so, Sarah would ask to get out for a bit to sit on the sand but we all kept saying no. Later, Sarah says she’s had enough and goes back to the shore by herself.

Looking back now I feel badly because I know I could’ve just made the kid something like plain scrambled eggs and I didn’t do it because I didn’t feel like going out of my way. 

They can’t afford childcare and were coming over right from work which I wasn’t thinking about at the time, so might’ve been banking on me to provide dinner since they wouldn’t have had time to stop at home. (They ended up just not coming.)

I have a friend that wants me to paint a picture of his mom and dad when they were young as a gift to her. It’s a really sweet gift. I agreed to do it. I always ask for a deposit so that I don’t have to spend too much out of pocket on supplies. He told me that his mom was sick, so I told him to just buy me the canvas for now. He can pay me later. I gave him an estimated time of six weeks to finish the painting, and he was cool with that. 

About a week later he hit me up and told me that his mom was taking a turn for the worse, and wondered if I could hurry along the painting. I told him that I would try to have it finished as soon as I could, but I have several other commissions lined up. They *actually* paid me, so I need to have it to them in the time frame that I gave them. 

He said that since he’s my friend ,I should do him a favor and let him cut the line. He doesn’t think the others would notice the difference. 
I had to let him know that I couldn’t do that. I assured that the painting would be done in my original timeframe. 

In the mean time he has been telling everyone in ear shot how heartless I am for not finishing this faster for his dying mom.

"ejx7ah","1578147882","WIBTA for asking for my part of the inheritance?","Backstory:

So my grandfather passed away in October, apparently without a will (my uncle’s best friend/lawyer is looking for it). He wasn’t rich but had a reasonable amount of money stashed away. 

Meanwhile there’s the issues with my uncle and my father. After my mom died, my father’s hoarding behavior got worse. I moved out. He adopted 2 cats. My uncle has been dealing with alcohol and substance abuse issues (party due to being permanently physically disabled) and just got out of jail. He’s also allergic to cats. 

So lawyer wants to move my uncle in with my father, at least for a little while. Of course I think this is a terrible idea but what’s worse is my father is trying to pay my pet deposit ($250 and $25 a month) and have me take the cats. My apartment is 545 square feet (these cats don’t particularly like each other, so they will not be able to avoid each other). I also have a parrot in this very enclosed space. 

So here’s my problem: I know there is at least enough in my grandfather’s estate to pay off my car loan and put a down payment on a decent sized condo (I’ve already been looking). My mortgage would end up being cheaper than my rent. I would definitely be able to take on either the cats or my uncle. But I feel like asking for the money is kind of morbid. AITA? What should I do?

EDIT: I never once said I thought it was my inheritance. Im merely asking for part so I can be in a better situation to take the cats in. I’m also the only grandchild (2 step grandchildren, my half sisters from my mother’s side), and no one has spoken to my grandfather’s ex wife since they divorced in the 60’s (she is deceased with 1 living daughter from her second marriage; I know this through ancestry.com, my father doesn’t).","1578150862.0","Asshole","14","15"

"ejxbq3","1578148573","AITA for not wanting to bring a dish to a 200 person potluck wedding?","One of my cousins is getting married, and she wants/needs to do her food potluck. That's less of an issue for a small wedding, but there will be an estimated 200 people at this wedding. Of course, the wedding party has already claimed the easier things like plates, napkins, drinks, and rolls.

**Every independent household** is ""required"" to bring a dish for all guests. I'm technically an independent household because I live in my own place, but I live in a small apartment with roommates. I can't wrap my head around the logistics of making food for that many people. I've never made food for more than 6, and usually I'm cooking for one. 

1. I don't really have the ability to cook that much at once with my kitchen equipment, so I'd have to cook it in batches and somehow combine it later (and transport it somehow).

2. I can't really afford to make food for that many. I could do a simple pasta with red sauce, but they need it to be a ""filling dish"" aka have meat and/or cheese. I'm not a vegan or anything, but I can't afford to feed hundreds meat. I had the idea of adding lentils or making the sauce a cream sauce, but that's still not good enough. My estimates with my ""inferior"" dish are about $55, which is still a lot for me, but adding beef or chicken adds $75 to that, which is unreasonable for me.

3. I don't really have time to do all of this. My fridge is small and I share it with other people, so I'd basically have to do all this the day before, which not only a work day, but I'd also have to do all this and immediately leave for the wedding. 

Now, I could get bins from the dollar store, but these methods raise the risk of the food going bad. I'm willing to not eat anything at this wedding, I have my doubts that this won't end in food poisoning anyway. They're asking for gifts too of course, and I could give more if I didn't bring food.

**Edit:**

My estimates are based on Aldi prices, and the estimate that I'd need 25 pounds of pasta, 20-24 jars of sauce, and a bag of lentils. It's possible that I would need more and my estimates are low.

**Edit 2:**

This is BY HOUSEHOLD. Every household must make a dish to feed 200. It gets confusing because I'm a household of 1 (technically) but most of them are 6-10 people. I've asked the bride directly.","1578149517.0","Asshole","20","125"

The smell must have been coming from food that had be left out. The place was unkept in general.

He was clearly offended and started chewing me out for saying that. Even went as far as saying he should kick me out. I let him speak and tried to think of the best was to rectify this situation.

I just said “listen man, I didn’t mean for it to come out like that. I was trying to be funny if anything. But honestly it’s probably a good idea if you clean this place up.”

That didn’t really help as he noticed I didn’t really apologize. He went on to say how he was proud to have his own place. I said yes that is something to be proud of, I understand that dissing your new place the first time I am here is rude and I am sorry.

We eventually smoothed it out enough to drop the subject. Still was a little awkward for the remainder of my visit. We turned on the Xbox and he couldn’t find the other controller so he just let me play a round of cod.

So the night before my birthday I get lit and completely embarrass myself and my friend in front of company. I'm sloppy when I'm drunk or high, and its partly why I never do in the first place. As a result of this, my friend (let's call him KG) pulls me to the side the next day and gives me some harsh constructive criticism, which I admit I took harder than I shouldve. He was very blunt and I guess that's what I needed.

Fast forward to my birthday. I wake up in a pretty great mood and my boss even takes me out to lunch. But later on in the day, family drama pops up and I had to deal with my extremely abusive father who didn't want my family doing anything to celebrate with me. He got his way, and the fact that I wasn't able to see my mother and sister because of him really brought me down. Over all, I was feeling really shitty, and I felt that I just wanted to be alone. I had plans to go over to KG's apartment that night to play games and chill, so after making my decision I let him know I would be staying home. Things were fine on my end until an hour or so later I get a phone call asking where I am? Apparently KG, his girlfriend, and another mutual friend had all linked up and were calling trying to come pick me up to celebrate my birthday... But I had explained to ALL of them previously that I would be staying home! This just ends up giving me crazy anxiety because I felt shitty for not wanting to do anything with them, so I try to put my mind off of it and get some rest.

A few days after this, our mutual friend sends a message in our groupchat. I respond to it and KG's girlfriend calls me out on why I didn't show up to hang out with them. One thing leads to another and I end up finding out that they saw this as absolute betrayal. Long story short, this leads to me confessing my mental breakdown to my friend, and I truly thought this would clear the air. But then he sends me a very long paragraph about how I just have to ""man up"" and how the world doesn't stop for me. I dont have a screenshot, but the paragraph was truly appalling to me.

We gave her £900 and paid child support every month, the court ordered amount which I will admit was barely anything (£10 a week)

I’m a college student who is home visiting for the holidays. I fly out today, and this all happened yesterday night. 

Let me start with: I have no issue including my sister in things I do. She’s funny, and while she definitely needs a lot of help with playing games, my friend group and I have always gone out of our way to include her. The previous day I was up with both of my sisters playing D&D with them and my friends until 1am. My disabled sister has a TBI and tired out around 11. We also threw a Christmas party with which we were also including her in all of the games we played. 

As this was my last night home, I wanted to run a more complex campaign with my friends by ourselves. We went to our local hobby shop, and as we were setting up, my father had taken it upon himself to drop my little sister, her boyfriend, and my disabled sister off in the middle of the game. We were all kinda upset but we tried to build her a character anyways. This campaign was just too complex for her, and she got frustrated and stormed off. My younger sister asked my dad to pick them up. 

Later I get a text from my mother, which I will copy and paste: 

“You were a real jerk today! I did not raise you to act like this! You should be ashamed of yourself! I am so disappointed in you! Tonight you were a bully!”

I won’t lie. I did kind of blow up at her when I read that. I was very offended, as I spent my entire break home cleaning their house (they’re hoarders), playing games with my sisters, and spending time with them. This was the one night I had planned out in advance to just see my friends. My mom and I argue back and forth for a while, both being pretty nasty to each other. Then my father texts me this: 

“I think you need to change your legal residence when u get back home to (city I go to school in). We’ll pay the final semester as promised and the rent so we don’t stick it to (boyfriends mom who co-signed our lease). When school ends your on your own.”

I’m a sophomore, so this will mean I will have to drop out of school. (For more context, they agreed to pay rent because it was cheaper than the dorms). Im just really confused and this is just such a bizarre situation. I’m obviously very distraught as I’ve been essentially kicked out and cut off. Over board games and DnD. I don’t think I was TA in wanting to see my friends alone before I left. I’m just really confused

The 2nd comes around and I dont hear anything from him all day. I get home around 6 and ask where the money is. He tells me he only had $425 of it since his employer split his vacation time where he was short on his paycheck. On top of that, he couldn't pay me the rest until the 16th

After about 5 minutes of this, I ask him, ""Whose dog is the humper?"" and he points to the other guy.   So I asked this guy to stop letting his dog hump other dogs.  

My understanding is that mounting/humping is a learned behavior.  And my concern is that my dog will see this as acceptable behavior and pick it up with some Monkey See - Monkey Do bullcrap. 

I don't remember my exact words, but I wasn't confrontational, I said something along the lines of ""Come on man you can't let your dog hump other dogs""  

Obviously he had no concern about this, and he says ""Un-huh, you think I should do something about it?""

I responded ""Yeah, push your dog off, It's a learned behavior, I don't want my dog picking it up""

Most people brought pre-made stuff like meat and cheese platters fruit platters, ice cream and the like. One of my coworkers is very well known for baking stuff, let’s call her Susie. 

Susie bakes stuff for the office all the time, and I used to eat her baked goods until I had to drop her off at her house. She was having car troubles and her house was on the way to my house. I asked her if I could come up and use the restroom because I had a drive a head of me. 

When I walked into her house the smell knocked me back. It smelled like rotting food and cats. Susie has like 8 cats and they walk everywhere in her house, including on the kitchen counter. I also saw a litter box that was completely full. I don’t have cats, so I don’t know how often they need to be changed but it *smelled*. Her bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned. Her kitchen was fucking terrible. Dirty shit and old food everywhere. From there on I told myself I would never eat anything that Susie prepared in her house. 

As I was saying her baked goods are an office favorite, so everyone was having a piece of her cake at the potluck but me. A few of my coworkers asked me why I wasn’t eating the cake, and I described to them the state of her home. They didn’t want to eat her cake either, one of them even threw her slice away. 

I guess word got around the office, and today when Susie brought baked goods nobody touched them. Eventually word got back to her that I told everyone that her house was nasty. People are distancing themselves from her. She says she’s filing and HR complaint against me for gossiping. I was just being honest with my coworkers, and I am asshole?

Edit to clarify. 
I did tell the coworkers “privately” as in I didn’t scream across the office “SUSIE IS A SLOB. DO NOT EAT HER FOOD”. I told a couple of people and they told others because most people think that it’s nasty AF to have animals on your counters in your kitchen.

Edit to clarify #2
Several of y’all have told me to add the fact that I have gotten food poisoning TWICE in the last three months to my post.

I came out of the shower about half an hour ago and my mum was crying I gave her a hug, she pushed away and not knowing what else to do I walked back to my room. She calls me back out and asked why I didn’t ask  her what’s wrong I told her I didn’t know what to do because I don’t know what to do in these situations. She went on a rant about how her work treats her like shit even though she did everything for them ( they do this to everyone) and that she hates this town and that she’s worried for me and that she doesn’t know why no one ever takes her places. She then ended it with a “let’s go do something tomorrow, you and me” which I fell silent to. She asked me why I didn’t want to go and I told her I didn’t want to make her more upset, She pushed me towards it and so I said “I don’t want to hang out with her.” I then said I’m sorry and embarrassingly walked back to my room where I am now. I graduated from high school afew months ago so I’m scared she’ll kick me out.

(For background: She has like 5 siblings and her mum was aparently autistic and only hated my my mum out of them all)

"ejxvax","1578151382","AITA for not apologizing to my sister?","In 2018 I was struggling a lot with my mental health and I reached out to my sister for some guidance. I said something to her along the lines of “I’m really depressed and am finding it hard to do anything including my college classes and I don’t know what to do” and she responded with “I was depressed in college and I sucked it up so should you”. I kinda just dropped it there and didn’t push the issue anymore and secluded myself. It continued to bother me but I just suppressed it. Fast forward like six months, I reached out to her again and she shot me down again. So, I finally stuck up for myself and told her how every time I’ve reached out to her that she’s ignored my calls for help and that I was never going to come to her anymore and that she’s really hurt me. She responded with “I can’t believe you would say I don’t care about mental health, it really hurts me that you would say I wasn’t there for you when I’m a huge advocate for mental health awareness”. So, after that we didn’t talk for like a month then eventually she gave me this half ass apology and i accepted it and move on. My mom asked me if I apologized to her and I said “why would I have to when she’s the one who hurt me? I didn’t do anything wrong besides telling her she hurt me” and then my mother told my sister I said that which then lead to her bitching me out and going back on her apology and us not talking for another month. It wasn’t until my dad got involved (who was on my side) that things were resolved. In the end, I did apology to her just so it would end and I never got an apology from her. I think about this all the time and I’m sorry if the story is confusing and my grammar sucks lol. but am i the asshole for not apologizing to my sister initially?

edit: she did “apologize” before the ordeal with my mother. but her apology was basically “i’m sorry that you got upset”. she never took responsibility for her actions. after the issue with my mom and then my sister went off on me and took back her “apology”.","1578152872.0","Not the A-hole","9","14"

I (26m) am from a family with 15 kids and most of my sibblings have 2-6 kids already with zero plans of slowing down. I recently seperated from my religious community, because of my sexual orientation. Most people in these situations would be disowned, my family has simply asked I don't bring any partners around because it goes against their beliefs (not that I've ever had a long term partner anyways) and I'm always invited to family functions since I only live a few hours away. Over Thanksgiving I went and all anyone could talk about was the babies. Oh you should do it this way, well you know this is the best way to... Blah blah... It was so boring. My sister who I am very close to (and we're the closest in age) was slow to have kids because she waited the longest out of my sister's to get married. She just had a baby and it totally changed her and her once chill husband has turned into a neurotic person. Every time I hold the baby he asks my sister if I'm experienced enough (I'm 6th of 15 and Ive held a lot of babies) but when the baby has a poopy diaper he was more than willing to throw her my way and say ""good for future experience"". The thing is, I don't really care about kids. I feel like my entire childhood revolved around my parents having kids, my whole life has been surrounded by kids and I don't get the appeal of a baby. So they had a party this weekend and asked me to drive down and I wanted to be honest with my sister so I told her ""I don't think I'm going to stay with you guys anymore I just really don't like how (husband) acts and all you talk about is the baby and I feel like I don't add anything to the conversation and I just am sick of hearing the same baby facts over and over again"". She blew her lid at me and told me it was bad enough that I had broken our parents heart by leaving Christianity and becoming gay (I actually still am a Christian, currently attending a very wonderful Presbyterian Church who accepts LGBTQ members) and all day I've gotten calls about how awful it was to say that about new parents and that every child is a blessing from God and I need to learn to appreciate the miracle of life.

Let me tell you the story. I had this one friend who I  met during ""school"", she was dating this guy who we weren't supposed to hang out unless it was related to work because he was our senior.
(The job we have wanted at the time requires you to live in the barracks while studying at school to get the job you wanted. If you failed your classes you would be promptly removed from class to go to a different place to study a different job. Our seniors are people that already been working there for a while and they just want to change their jobs.)
 Well she failed her classes and they're sending her to another place to study a different job. As she was packing she was telling me her life story amd one part was her ex gave her a type of STDs that isn't curable (so she says tbh idk what type). I asked her if she told her BF, her reply was no cause she was scared of him rejecting her and told me all the guys she dated or wanted to left her cause of it and she didn't want to be alone anymore. She also said he was a sweet guy and didn't want to loose him so ON PURPOSE  she had sex with him W/O protection so he can have it and then he can stay with her.
 I was appalled and told her she needed to tell me cause this is a thing that will affect for the rest of his life. She begged me not to tell him and told me she will tell him everything eventually. She promised me that.
Welp had had a couple weeks before I graduated and leave that place, I asked one of my friends who was also her friend if I should tell him. She already knew about this way longer than I had and said it wasn't my business and leave it alone.

Now to present time her now EXBF, I found out she never told him and instead people found out I knew about this and telling I'm a terrible person for not telling him and I'm a monster for ruining a person life

"ejy7vo","1578153130","AITA for not liking the planner my boyfriend gifted me and wanting to get a new one?","For the past 10 years now I’ve been using a daily planner to help organize my life. I get a different one every year but it’s basically a book that allows me to jot down by day all my appointments, to dos, sometimes I write down an interesting quote or random fact. Typically I get one with a pretty cover and photos/patterns on the pages. I rely on it a lot and refer to it multiple times a day because my memory is terrible and otherwise would never know where I’m supposed to go or end up double booking myself. 

For the past 3 years I’ve been dating my boyfriend, I’ve asked him to get me the planner as my Christmas gift. I don’t want expensive gifts, and it’s something I use everyday and would remind me of him. The first two years he got me planners that I liked and used, though they were more “professional” looking - one was a plain black cover, the second a very high quality leather cover. I typically prefer more “fun” covers - think floral, animals, colorful patterns. But honestly I didn’t mind too much and still enjoyed the gifts and never said anything to him when I got them. 

This year, like usual, I ask for the planner. I can’t remember my words to him verbatim but I think I said something like “can you get one with an interesting cover”? 

Side note, he has full access to all my planners and I’m constantly referring him to them, like if he asks “are you free this Saturday” my response is usually “go look at my planner”. So he sees what I write in them and how I use them. 

Well, he ended up spending a lot of time on the internet and found a planner with a cover of a show I really like, it’s a show most people have never heard of and I’m sure it wasn’t easy for him to find this so I truly appreciate the effort. 

However, the practical part of the planner is terrible. The way the pages are laid out, each “day” has only a tiny space to write in, not nearly enough for everything I typically want to jot down. The paper itself is thin and of poor quality and I’ve already accidentally ripped one of the pages. They have pages built in for “goals” but I don’t really do that. I guess I can repurpose the “goals” pages and use it for something else, but it seems messy to me to do it that way. 

Anyway, I love the cover and the effort he’s put in finding it, but practically it’s not a planner I would actually enjoy using. I tried to explain this to him gently yesterday, and I could just see the disappointment on his face and it made me feel terrible. He said I can get a new one if I want, but I feel like he would be hurt if I actually did.

My bf compliments me a lot and it’s very nice. However, he compliments his sister in the same way, and I find it creepy. For example, when we saw her recently she was wearing a crop top and he said “you look sexy” and then asked me in front of her to verify that she looked sexy. I found it so weird.

Another time, he was standing beside me staring at her and said to her “you are so beautiful” - then asked again for me to back him up and tell her how beautiful she was. He frequently compliments her to me when she is not there, showing me pictures of her to show that she is beautiful. Today we are at the beach and she arrived wearing a very normal/plain black swimsuit and he says to me “did you see my sister? She looks so good!” I don’t know how to respond to his praise of his sister in a swimsuit - my brother might tell me what I wear is cool but he’s def not going to brag about my swimsuit body.

He compliments me a lot so it’s not that. I also don’t feel threatened by their relationship or anything, I mean it’s very normal - just the comments are off putting to me and usually about things I don’t even know how to respond to. She will literally wear sweats/joggers and a T-shirt and in front of her he will ask me, doesn’t she look so great and so fashionable?! She is a cute/normal girl and seemingly looks the same as always, it’s not like she used to look one way and changed.

I wasn't informed about that, so I didn't really have any time to pepare some child-friendly games to entertain the kid.  
Following that logic I just decided to play with her by picking her up and spinning her around a bit, which she really enjoyed. I did that by just grabbing her forearms with my hands and lifting her, she already had her arms stretched out in the air so it's not like I pulled her up from all the way down.   
In that process she didn't get hurt or complained, and I was really careful the entire time.   
Her mother however informed me that it looked too dangerous and that I should pick her up by grabbing her under the armpits instead.   
That, I thought, was fair enough. because that's how parents usually pick up their kids anyway.   
So following that logic I continued, but once again I was told to stop roughhousing the kid and that she would get hurt.    
At that point I was a bit perplexed, but it was her kid, and I'm not anywhere close to becoming a parent, so I complied.

Instead of picking her up, I just held her hands and we jumped around in circles for a bit. But for the third and last time, I was yelled at to stop being so rough with the child. The mother called her over and she was forced to sit at the table with the adults for entire time. She looked incredibly bored. 

I apologized to the mother and just started doing my own thing. Later, when everybody left, my own mom told me that she was disappointed in me for not listening to the mom, and that she can't have friends over when I'm there anymore.  


I don't understand their point of view. I followed everything the girls mother told me to, the kid was happy when she played with me and I even apologized afterwards, even though I think the mom was just being overprotective.

I got my gaming set up for my birthday mainly because my siblings didnt let me play what once was my Xbox. I got it about 4 months ago. It cost around €700 for the monitor, PC, keyboard and mouse.

At first when I got it I was the only one to use it, with my father also knowing the password incase I searched up anything suspicious. My brother (12) and sister (9) begged me to let them play but I decided to not share the password in hope that my dad wouldn't give into them either.

About a month passes up until I come home after a night out with my mates to see my brother playing a game of mine on my set up, luckily, nothing was ruined, however I was extremely annoyed that my dad allowed him to play the computer.

I had a chat with my dad and he assured me that he'd only let my brother play when I was out with my friends.

I reluctantly agreed to this, however only because he made me feel bad if I didn't, something alot of people do to me as they know I hate disappointing others.

This continues up until about 2 months ago where it seems he is getting addicted to it and begs me to play it even if I am using it. I told him to f*ck of and get his own, which led to me being banned for a week and he got to play it all he wanted.

The week ends and I come back to a very laggy gaming set up. At first I though it was because it was cheap for a gaming set up, then considered it was possibly because my brother downloaded an apk of some game. In the end it was neither.

You see, during this week, my dad told my sister the password and she downloaded the one thing that f*cks up all computers. Roblox.

For anyone who isn't aware, this game causes alot of lagging when downloaded even when it's not running.

So I started buying my own gluten free bread and pasta, sometimes even cookies. I'm in HS and only work weekends, so I don't have much money to spend, but I'm okay with doing it this way. Completely changing my diet would be a bigger hassle. 

Problem is that my mom eats it too. If she's too lazy to get bread from the freezer she'll eat mine. I would be okay with that if she replaced it, but it's happened several times that for breakfast she'd take the last few pieces. Leaving me to skip breakfast, or be late for school to go get more. 

I've asked her to stop, but she doesn't take it seriously. My aunt told me that I spend the last 17 years eating my mom's food, so I should be happy to return the favour. I don't really agree.

My husbands birthday is today and we planned a cabin trip up north with another one of our couples friends to go snowboarding, play games, relax, etc. I will refer to this couple as Ann & Chris. Ann & Chris confirmed with us weeks ago that they are planning on coming with us, they just had to finish work and would be heading up later than we would so we will be driving separate. Now this other couple who we routinely hangout with, Andy & April, were also invited but Andy couldn’t make it due to working the weekend. We were bummed but still happy to have some of our friends with us for the trip to celebrate my husbands birthday. Fast forward to New Years Eve. We were hanging out with these same two couples. April brought up how bummed she was to not be able to come because her husband has to work. We all sympathized and said it was unfortunate but we would try to do another trip up north soon that we could all make it to. She then joked about just coming up herself and we didn’t really confirm or deny if she could just said something along the lines of “haha yeah maybe.”  Well yesterday Ann & Chris show up late and April is with them. I was asleep at the time, and so only my husband was there to greet them & help them get their stuff inside. He woke me up last night and told me about how she had come after he had come to bed. We had no idea she was coming and don’t have the food prep etc for her. I’m a little upset at Ann & Chris for not mentioning it, but mainly angry at April for just showing up.

Some time later I get a text msg (exactly) ""Hi \[my name\], Please confirm if you will be joining in-class  tomorrow at 9.00 am, Thanks"" and then ""\[school name\] \[school address\]"". I checked the website just to be sure, and the address matches, so it should be ok.

&#x200B;

I respond ""I'll be there"", and they reply ""Ok thanks"".

&#x200B;

So next morning I show up at the address, it's one of those big parking lots with restaurants, stores and small business we have here in Canada. No sign of a driving school though.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing though, from where I'm from, this is a big red flag for a scam, which I was already feeling since they sent me a message asking me to show up next day, no word on how much they would charge me, what are the plans from the lessons, etc . If that happened on where I'm from, I was being kidnapped for the third time by now. But whatever... They say Canada is safe...

&#x200B;

So I send a message: ""How do I find the school?"". One minute later someone calls me, but I don't want to answer. Partly because that's how a kidnapper would identify his victim - by the one that picks up the phone (yeah yeah, I'm a little paranoid), but mostly because it's a simple question, just tell me how to get there! Another phone calls me and I don't answer either.

&#x200B;

So I get a text message ""Please call me"". And I answer ""Nah, went to the address, couldn't find it. This whole thing is weird. Looks like a scam, I'm out"". A minute later they reply ""School is open"" and ""I am here"". That didn't help me find it, so I just took off. went buy groceries (that I planned to do after the class) with my phone ringing nonstop.

&#x200B;

Later (exaclty): ""Hi \[my name\], very unfortunate that you could not find the school. There is main entrance with sign board  \[business name, but it's some kind of clinic\], you open the main entrance and come to upper level first one is \[another business\], 2nd is \[another business\] and third is suite \[number on the address\], \[name of the driving school\]"" and then ""Our school instructor can give you ride if you want to come now"" and then ""Or give me a call"".

&#x200B;

Is it so hard to tell people how to get to your business instead of giving them just half the info needed? and like hell I would get a ride from a stranger now... Am I the paranoid asshole? Or just paranoid?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok, I get it, I probably wasn't getting kidnapped (even though that's what people think right before they do get kidnapped). But it did sound very scammy. When people try to call me to give me very simple information (""3rd floor above \[business name\]"", or ""Entrance at \[ \]"") I start thinking that they want to stall, try to hide something, or try to make you do something/go somewhere else, and since you're already there you go and do it. That's how scams work. But yeah, I agree I get a little paranoid.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: For people saying I didn't make effort trying to find the place. I did. These plazas (that's the word I was looking for) usually have kind of a billboard with a bunch of brands and establishments working on the plaza. I did find the billboard, but didn't find the name of the driving school. I looked on googlemaps where you can find some pictures of the place, it had a picture of an empty classroom and some people next to cars (no photo of the entrance). I actually know how to drive (10 years driving from where I'm from, never got even a scratch on my car), but since I moved to Canada, even though everyone I know says I should just pay for someone to teach me how to pass the test, I believe people should do a formal training of the law and how driving works here (one of the reasons insurance is expensive is because everyone wants to save on learning how to drive properly). So I woke up early on the weekend and walked for 30 minutes to the address provided at 0 degrees and snowing. So yeah, I did make effort to find the place.","1578160406.0","Not the A-hole","19","26"

4 years ago when Eldor was applying to universities, we had the conversation about costs. We live in Georgia, which is relevant because Georgia has a state scholarship that pays for pretty much the entirety of one’s college bill. I told my children that out-of-state costs are too exorbitant, and I encouraged them to find schools in Georgia that they liked. As a result, my son went to GA Tech.

Two years ago, Rebecca applied to college with the expectation of going to UGA. With her stats, it was pretty much a shoe in. However, her counselors made her apply to 2 other schools on top of that, so she applied (and got accepted into) Dartmouth.

However it was expensive (I make a lot, so financial aid only covered half of the $80,000/year cost to go there). After a LOT of pleading and promises that she’ll do well, I relented on the condition that she maintains good grades, showed me her transcripts every semester, and that she transfers in-state if she couldn’t keep up. She accepted. 

So for the last 1.5 years, we’ve been doing that. Every semester she’d show me her transcripts (she’d get anywhere between a 3.0 - 3.7). Everything was fine until this morning, I lost my retainers, and searched the trash to see if I threw them away. 

In there, I saw an unopened letter addressed to me from her school. It was peculiar because I definitely did not see it. I opened it, and it said that Rebecca was on Academic Warning, and she needed to improve her grades by next semester or she’d be on probation. 

To make a long story short, she’s been lying. She’s been giving me screenshots of doctored grades and she currently has a 2.1. To make matters worse, they sent me a letter last semester, but I found out she threw it away. She’s been non-stop crying and apologizing  and promising that she will improve.

I’m hurt Reddit. I’m hurt that my daughter would boldface lie to me. Every conversation about school was her continuing to keep up the lie. She says she’s changing majors, dropping extracurriculars, and is committed to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

But I don’t know Reddit. I feel like the damage is done. I’ve been shelling out 20 grand a semester, and she’s not even passing her classes. I understand ivy leagues are tough, but I feel like that doesn’t excuse lying to me. Also, she’s already enrolled for next semester, so I’m on the hook for the next 20k for her spring semester.

"ejyp2w","1578155388","AITA for getting my roommate’s ESA dog banned?","I will include a link to texts between us about this below.

Basically, my roommate is a nightmare. She has been letting her dog, who is potty trained, pee in our kitchen and then leaving it. She doesn’t take her out often enough or buy puppy pads. She usually gets to it within 24-36 hours of the mess being made but when it’s longer I have had to ask her to clean it several times. I have communicated to her several times that dog piss being left about is a serious issue for me. She thinks I hate it because I have OCD but honestly I don’t think anyone would just be cool with dog piss.

If she asks me to walk her dog and I have time I’m always glad to. In the past I’ve fed her and trained her a bit as well. She’s a good dog and I love dogs, I just am not ok with being her free dog walker more than 2-3 times a week because I have 2 jobs, I’m a student as well, and I specifically don’t have a dog because I know I don’t have the time to take care of one properly. I also buy all the cleaning supplies in the apartment and recently she asked me to buy her some bleach based cleaners because mine “aren’t good enough”. I did and had them in my room to give to her but hadn’t yet.

We got in an argument where I asked her to take care of the pee that was dried in the pantry and had been there for several days the day I was asking her. She has no job and no school to go to so it’s not unreasonable to ask her to do it within 24 hours. It turned into a huge argument and at the end I said I’d call the landlord and she still refused to clean it that day. 

I immediately called the landlord because she had basically refused to even agree to try and clean it that day, and she had said several things that bothered the hell out of me. I put the cleaning supplies in the living room and left for therapy and then work.

When I called the landlord the landlords office told me that they would give her a stern phone call and it would be taken care of. At no point did it enter my mind they could ban her because in my experience renting even with someone who has a nightmare pet the landlord can’t just ban it in CT.

So I get to work and we have the text conversation below. In summary, I tell her that I did not intend for her dog to be banned, and gave her some avenues to get it back, and she insists it was unreasonable for me to call the landlord in general over this and I’m a “psycho”, and she’s not going to bother trying to get her dog back.

AITA here? I get that it sucks hard her dog is banned, but I feel like she didn’t give me any other choice than to call the landlord.

Edit: she’s home and she brought the dog. I’m avoiding her and I have no idea what’s going on.

Another edit: There are more replies than I expected and people are having trouble finding the texts. Here is another [link](https://imgur.com/a/I5YQLAT)

Edit 3, now it’s Saturday night. There’s piss in the pantry and she’s in bed with her dog. She didn’t put down the puppy pads she bought.

Edit 4: more [texts](https://imgur.com/a/JB1E9x9) . She came home from going to church to clean up the pee, and I didn’t get why until I realized I didn’t respond to where she said she’d do it when she got back. I’m the jerk on that bc I didn’t read the whole text. I stayed in my room and then took her dog to the park while she was here to avoid an argument.","1578239831.0","Not the A-hole","171","159"
"ejypt3","1578155483","AITA for spending money gifted to our children?","My OH and I both make fairly good money in our jobs. We have no debt apart from our mortgage and up until recently we also had significant savings.

Recently, however, we have had some unlucky events happen which have eaten up all our disposable cash and savings. We are talking high 5 figures worth of unforeseen and unavoidable expenses, although none medical thankfully. Due to our savings, we have been able to absorb these costs without resorting to loans, but it has left us with just enough to cover the essential bills for a few months. We will be fine, but will have to tighten our belts, cancel some trips planned etc.

Now, OH has a large extended family who generally just send our kids (2.5 and 1) money for birthdays/Christmas. They are very generous and over Christmas both kids ended up with nearly $1000 which we have put straight in their bank accounts. However, OH has suggested we use the kids' money to help cover some expenses so we don't have to cancel all the plans we have made for January and February (day trips, family visits and a long weekend away with close friends). 

His argument is that the kids are too young to understand we have borrowed their money and they will enjoy the trips as they get to play with their cousins and our friends' kids. He also argues we should be able to pay them back by the summer (barring any more disasters!). I just feel like such an a-hole taking money from our kids' accounts that we don't strictly need; we can still pay essential bills, we just need to do without luxuries like trips for a bit. We have been debating this since Christmas day!

"ejywe6","1578156313","AITAH for charging my mom rent?","Hello, fellow redditors, I need your help as I can’t decide who’s feelings are most justified in this situation. 

Context: I am 32F single living in my own one bedroom apartment.  The town I currently live in is close by my mom’s work about a fifteen min drive. This is not a crazy coincidence as my current town is also about 10mins from the town/house I grew up in that my parents commuted from to work every day.  My parents had 2 homes: the main house that I referenced above and their shore house 45 miles south. 

3 years ago, Dad retires. They decide it’s time to sell the main house and live full time in the shore house.  Mom decides to work for 1 more year then will retire. Her commute now amends from 10mins to 1hr plus drive each way.  Mom approaches asking if she can stay at my apt 3 nights a week and will pay me for it. (Although, I have no issue with her staying with me I don’t think I ever had a choice as I didn’t want my mom making that long commute every day either) 

I proposed 8K flat for the year (33% annual), she agreed and paid. FYI- my mom is an easy roommate. Nonetheless, she sleeps on a cot in my living room mon,tues,thurs. 

Fast forward to year three, Oct 2019 lease renewing. Mom still not retired so I ask if she plans to renew with me for same amount 8k. (My rent increases every year) She replies “yes” but with resentment. I brush it off. Month after month goes by with reminders and no check. 

I confront her one night asking what is going on. She said “I’ve been thinking about it and very disappointed because no one else would charge their mom’s rent to stay at their house and we never charge you to stay at the shore house every weekend. We have been too generous with our children and it has been detrimental to their independence. You make a lot of money now and I hope you save it. Furthermore, your father and I are spending A TON of money right now so it difficult”  
My response points:
1. So you and Dad convinced yourselves that you’ve been giving me 8k of charity every year?! I have saved you both money by you staying with me instead of getting your own apt. You were supposed to leave after year one, but I made it too comfortable I guess! End of day it’s mutually beneficial economically for both parties.
2. Any argument you attempt now is not valid b/c rent is 3 months past due. Were you just hoping I’d let it go and not approach you about 8 GRAND!
3. I don’t care how much money I make, $8k is a lot of money that I budget for every year. 

INFO: parents are spending “A TON” of money right now because they started building their new $$$$$ beach home w intentions to sell the old one once finished. Oh and they are going to Israel on vacation Monday for about 10k. 

So the above is my argument but I can’t help but still feel like a moocher off my parents. If they didn’t have money I would never expect payment. I think my arguments make a lot of sense on paper but I still feel like a loser after my mom said that no one else would charge their parents rent.

EDIT: there seems to be some confusion going on around what my mom actually sleeps on. I think cot is the wrong word. It’s a Bobopedic ottoman pull out bed. It’s a twin bed with a very comfortable mattress. Her set up is pretty good.  It is like her own bedroom with all the amenities. If it wasn’t comfortable she would not have lasted this long. Basically we turn my LR into her bedroom three nights a week.

I started eating a healthier diet when I turned 18 a couple years ago, doing all my own cooking and cutting out dairy (found out I was lactose intolerant). As a result, over time, I have found I can't eat certain rich foods as much as the rest of my family and as much as I used to. Meals I don't have a problem with unless I load them up with a whole bunch of vegan cheese but I can't consume large quantities of most desserts. For my dad's birthday 2 months ago, I made him a chocolate layer cake. It was vegan but still had oil, sugar, chocolate, etc and was super rich. My mom cut me a perfectly normal sized piece and it was just so rich I couldn't finish it.

I do love dessert but I'm more of a fruit desserts or simple desserts person. My actual favourite dessert is a bowl of coconut milk ice cream with caramel sauce. Since I figured adult birthdays are more about alcohol and spending time with people you love, I didn't think it would be a big deal if I skipped the birthday cake. I'm always the one who makes birthday cakes for all the birthdays in the family, including my own, so I thought I'd save myself the trouble and make a dessert for me I could actually finish.

When I told my mom I wasn't going to make a cake this year but instead make a homemade caramel sauce and buy some non-dairy and some dairy ice creams for the party, she was annoyed. She said 'it's not a real birthday party without cake' and 'how can you possibly think ice cream and caramel sauce is an acceptable birthday dessert.'

AITA? I don't understand the problem. I'm the one who makes the cakes. I don't stop anyone else from getting cake on their birthday, but this year I don't want cake. Is it really that big a deal?","False","Not the A-hole","62","59"

My roommates girlfriend was at our place for a lot of the holidays as he had 2 weeks off. Pretty much the entire time she was over she had a pretty bad cold, to the point of calling in sick from work several times. 

After the brake was over I asked him to go to her place or something when she was sick as I had started to feel shitty and I think if your too sick to go to work you should stay home, so as to not get other people sick. 

He said that was fair but I feel a little guilty about it and I can't put my finger on why.

 she lives with her family and it's not easy for them to hang out at her place. 

She does not live at our place but spends a lot of time here (1-3 days a week depending on the time of year). She does not pay rent in anyway and I wouldn't expect her too. 

I do get along with her great, all three of us do hang out quite a bit including during the past couple weeks.

A few months later, I met a new guy. A lot less perfect, but we clicked instantly. I fell deeply in love. Still am. We moved in together. Adopted a dog. It’ll be three years in July. I got a happy ending. I got really lucky.

My ex did not. He met someone who, according to all of our friends, is controlling, jealous, rude, possessive as hell. My ex is incredibly conflict-averse, and he has a tendency to let people walk over him. By all accounts, she takes advantage of that.

When I was a baby my mother broke up with my father, gave him no justification for that, and went to live with my grandma, taking me with her. She then left me with my grandma to go live by herself and years later go work in another country. The only justification she's given me was that she was too busy with her job and didn't have time to raise me. So I ended up being raised by my grandma. She has also cut ties with my grandma, again for no discernible reason. She kept my legal custody (she says she didn't want my grandma to steal me away from her), making bureaucracies very hard for my grandma, and through that she received money from the government to help with my expenses but kept it for herself and never helped financially.

Other than visiting her sometimes while she lived here when I was little, a time when she lived with me and my grandma because a boyfriend of hers scammed her of all her money, and occasional visits to her where she lives now and vice-versa, I haven't had much contact with her. She rarely called me.

She came to my country to spend some time before christmas, leave, and then come back for new year's and her birthday (she tries to say that she can't give her part of the pension she owes my grandma now because she's tight on money) (only recently my grandma got my custody, she didn't do it sooner because she didn't want to fight with her daughter). And she asked me to meet her and spend time with her multiple times, and I went, mostly because she wanted to buy me some clothes and whatnot, tbh.

On her birthday, I said I'd meet her but had second thoughts. I don't like spending time with her, but I was afraid of feeling guilty, and most importantly, my grandma told me to go because if I didn't she'd spend her birthday alone, and I knew that if I didn't go, I wouldn't hear the end of it.

So I went but I decided to tell her the truth. That I met her because I was sorta forced to, that I didn't want to spend time with her, that it'd be better for the both of us if I just stopped pretending, that I used to meet with her in hopes that she'd be different, but since she isn't and I can't really force her to change, she can't also expect me to be excited to see her, and that if she wants to talk to me she can just call me like she has done until now, but that I don't wanna meet her anymore. The whole time she was like ""hmm, yeah, sure, I understand, no no really it's fine, it's good that you're being honest"" with that tone, and when she left me at the subway station to get home, she just jolted without saying bye.

If I could (I technically can, I'm 18) I'd just go no contact, but I don't wanna do that because of the same reasons why I met with her on her bday. People tell me to forgive her but she's said to me that she did nothing wrong and everything's fine.","False","Not the A-hole","10","13"

I am 23 now, and I just moved to the city where my parents live after finishing school. My dad is huge... incredibly obese. He has now been at this weight for the last 6 or 7 years. He was diagnosed with diabetes and developed gout recently. He continues to say ""its my addiction. Food is my addiction"".  I am so fucking sick of no one in my family saying anything.

I have ignored all of my family memebers and i continue to hound my dad about this almost every chance I get. Sometimes he accepts the criticism and other times he gets very angry with my comments. I am not saying anything offensive, but i make comments like ""did you really need to eat that"" or ""you need to start exercising or look into fasting"".. all he ever says is ""im getting there"" ""i will soon"".

After a parent meeting if my grades weren't the way my dad wanted them to be, I would always get a long abusive talk by my dad to the point of me crying. This happened all the way through elementary and middle school, usually twice a year. It was so bad to the point of me being afraid of going home. In high school, during a ride back home from a lesson, I broke down crying and told my dad how bad he made me feel throughout my kid years and how I was afraid to come home. He meant the world to me and disappointing him broke my heart every time it happened. He cried as well and treated me better in my high school years.
I decided to give him another chance.

During my high school years he kept saying that I should become a doctor and it's a very respected and well paid job. I agreed to this even though I didn't really know what I wanna study yet. They sent me to personal tutoring for over a year so I could get ready for my uni exams.

So, right now I'm in my final high school year and I decided that I dont wanna pursue a career in medicine and I wanna find something that suits me as well as go to uni in another country. Needless to say, my dad wasn't very happy. He blamed me for wasting his money on tutoring and told me that he cannot believe what I turned out to be. He said that my computer (I play video games) devoured my mind. He also kept laughing at my face while saying all of this. I lost all respect for him and told him to not speak to me and I will not treat him as my father anymore. I broke down and cried again, it reminded me of my childhood. 

I know part of this is my fault for being so indecisive and wasting their money but I feel like I got pressured into agreeing with him and to not disappoint him. I also told them I would pay them back the money whenever I got it.

Whilst there we went and visited all the family and friends as we don't go all that often. One particular family friend had told us not to buy a high chair for our baby as she would be providing us with one. We both thought great no need to splash out £100 on a highchair.

So we waited for this chair and then the friend brought it to my girlfriends family home and left it outside, which we thought was weird and just messaged her dad. We brought the chair inside and had a look at it. It was used, which is fine, but it was recently used and obviously for a long time too. Everything on this chair was either dirty from that grime that builds up in a kitchen near your hob, that sticky grime that has dust in it, or hit had food on it. The food was in all the cracks and ridges around the table. It was pretty disgusting.

I said as much, I in fact stated that they should have cleaned the chair before giving it to us, we are going to use it for our baby. This angered my girlfriends dad who shouted that I shouldn't complain about getting free gifts which I can't afford to buy myself.

I clarified that I meant just the state of the chair. But he said, 'that's a real shitty thing to do to people who are helping you out' and then left the room.

At no point before this event did he or I argue, actually quite the opposite we got on really well. So I know that his outburst was genuinely about the chair. But this put a sour note on the whole trip as we were leaving later that day and I didn't have another chance to speak to him.

Should I not have said anything? Honestly the chair was awful and I really do think they should have cleaned it before giving it away to another family. But am I wrong in thinking that should I have just been grateful and cleaned it myself? Which I did anyway.

FWIW I pay for uni with loans they cosigned for, but I am responsible for repaying. My mother got my sibling(s) phones from very young age--like elementary school--so we could check in with her since she is a bit of a worrier. Fast forward to that past few years. Every 2 or 3 years my sibling(s) and I get upgraded phones for x-mas and our family still covers our phone bills without issue because in exchange we check in with them semi frequently even though we are both moved out (I come home for holidays and have a lot of stuff there but being out of state at uni, I have an apartment too). Everything has been mostly fine up until recently, in the summer of 2019 she installs the Verizon Family Companion VPN because I am going across the nation for an internship and she can't just hop skip a few thousand miles to check in with me and generally wants to make sure if anything goes wrong she has my whereabouts. Okay. Sure. Also she is paying for the phone plan so I don't have much room to budge even if I don't like it.  After summer she also installs it on my sibling's phone because ""I have it on OP's phone and it gives me piece of mind."" Sibling also doesn't care for it as they are 3 years older than me and permanently moved out, but parents both want it, cover the phone bill and again there isn't much room to budge on that. 

Go to Christmas 2019, parent gives new to me that has the VPN on it already, but for some reason it doesn't have super accurate tracking this time and parent requests OFTEN, like a few times a day, that I check in to the GPS tracker on the app to augment its accuracy in addition to also texting her multiple times a day. It feels really invasive and exhausting. I'm willing to check in or text her, but both is just overkill. Solution, I want my own phone line and I don't want my parents constantly tracking me. They are upset it is in retaliation for the tracking and are calling me ungrateful and disrespectful, it has started this huge pissing match because ""they just want to make sure I am okay.""  I am willing to repay the new phone and take out the line in my name, but that doesn't seem to sit well with them. I don't feel like I have to be doing something wrong to be entitled to some basic privacy, but they also seem to think I must be up to something if I don't want to be tracked. I have talked to young people who think it's totally invasive -- go figure, but also have less intrusive family dynamics. I have talked to some other parents who are trying to get me to see that it's a testament of how much they care about me. I feel like it's ridiculous and I just want out, and I'm willing to pay my way there too but for reasons unknown to me this whole process has been incredibly damaging to our family dynamics, so reddit, AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","8","32"

Three of my friends want to go out to celebrate them graduating and there’s a fourth friend who lives quite locally and he recently started getting into drugs. 

The problem is I’ve applied for a job with the government that is due to start straight out of college and they’re doing some pretty invasive background checks on me. I totally get why they do the checks, and I agree they’re necessary. Because of this I’m 100% refusing to hang out with the 4th friend because he’s known to get drunk and then want to get more fucked up on drugs and has a real ‘all in it together’ mentality and thinks we all should be doing it. 

I’ve outright said I don’t want to hang with him. I’m not being sneaky about it I’ve said all this in an Insta chat he’s in, and I’ve said that if they want to invite him I won’t throw a tantrum I’ll just head home? 

They’re saying that he’s promising not to bring any drugs and promising that he won’t get fucked up, but I don’t believe him even a little. 

They’re now saying I’m causing an issue and should believe him. I don’t wanna go with him because if he’s arrested for something and I’m there and my job finds out then I’m instantly out and I don’t want that.

"ek03jl","1578161508","AITA for calling my friend at work and pretending to be her sister after being ignored for over two months?","So I (21F) have been best friends with Nina (21F) since the sixth grade. We hung out all the time, watched movies, came over to each others' house, and she even met my grandma after trying to steal a pair of my pants. Our friendship has been solid for over ten years, despite growing, we still come back to each other. Usually, we'd interact often throughout the day but in November, I started getting left on delivered (like being left on read, but the read receipts aren't on; more insidious imo) more and more often, and on the rare chance that she would respond, it would be one word answers. I was increasingly concerned because her social media was barren, which was unusual. She struggles with mental health issues that are currently untreated due to her financial situation. She can isolate herself when she's feeling down, but my friends and I intervene and help her when it happens.

So in the middle of December, she texted our group chat and asked us to go out to dinner to catch up. Of course I was in there like swimwear, but when I got there she was making next to no eye-contact with me, barely talking, and not laughing at my jokes all while literally sitting next to me. Fast-forward two weeks, I'm still texting her every day or so and still being ignored. Later, I broke up with my long-term bf. It hurt as we were gearing up to move out together and I reached out to her and got silence. This hurt as every time she'd have a break up or a guy problem, it was me who'd get the call at 12 or 1 in the morning (the sadboi hours, as you may already know) and be with her. But when I finally need her? Silence. I later saw on a mutual friend's instagram post her living it up at a NYE party. I was enraged.

Yesterday, I lost it. I went over to her house and knocked on the door, and a male relative answered and told me she wasn't home. I went home and called her job. It rang and her coworker picked up, and I asked to talk to her. She asked me who I was and I said ""her sister"". So the call was transferred to Nina, and I was like ""it's not your sister, it's me, why are you avoiding me"" and I cried on the phone. She was upset and said ""you can't call me at work for this, it isn't that important, I could have gotten in trouble"" and hung up. 

About 20 minutes later, she texted the group chat (SHE FOUND THE TIME) and we ended up arguing. She told us that she wasn't ignoring anyone, but busy but I countered and said ""you weren't too busy to party"". I then said ""I'm mad that you haven't made the time for us"", and then she left the group chat. Now Reddit, I had a moment of pettiness and added her back in the group chat. I said ""You left because you know I'm right. Something is up and we're being ignored. If you really want to make time for someone, you will, and I see we weren't worth it"". Then she left the group chat again, and I didn't add her back.

 Usually the guys Ash meets are from friends or blind dates and she likes to have me there as backup incase the guy is a creep. I genuinely don’t mind doing this. For the double date part she says it feels less awkward if I’m also “on a date” so Ashley usually finds a guy for me to go with or I bring a friend. I always like to make sure the people she sets me up with know I’m not interested in anything with them and I’m just there to support Ashley but lately they haven’t taken the hint and IM the one left dealing with creeps. I’m also talking to a guy and while we aren’t in a definitive relationship I know he would be uncomfortable with me going out with someone else even for the purpose of helping Ashley. 

So this is basically how our text conversation went:

Ash: Double date on Sunday (place and time)

Me: Alright sounds good can I bring (my guys name)

Ash: Already promised another guy he would be your date maybe next time 

Me: I’m not exactly comfortable with going out with strangers anymore, would you mind finding someone else this time?

No response. An hour later she gets on social media and talks about how some people are so unreliable and basically a long rant pointedly talking about me. My other siblings noticed this and told me that I was a jerk for cancelling on her and I should stop being a child and just go.

Everything was going fine until my sister started fucking things up. She would let me play on one of her days and expect me to let she play on all my days for a week, she would constantly tell me I'm ""Bad person for playing this stupid games all day"" and ""I should die and if I don't die she will kill me"" and moving to today she said that tomorrow should be her day and I'm so selfish for playing games in one of her days before yesterday she let me play but it was her day and she kept saying that I was so selfish for not letting her watch her series.
So today was her day and she said since I played before yesterday (Thursday I think) tomorrow (Sunday) should be her day again (for information my parents still let me play games during her days if she lets me because I can only play on weekends during school days and since we're on school holidays I used to play everyday because I can) and I said that tomorrow would be my day and my dad started agreeing with her (my mother isn't home) and to this moment I was chilling on my parents bedroom because my TV does not support Netflix.

TLDR at the bottom, and obligatory sorry for formatting because mobile. 

when i (22F) first met my boyfriend (23M) (will call him A) of over 3 years, I had blonde hair (I’m naturally a brunette). About 6 months in, I went back to my natural hair color and A was very vocal about how much he loved it, and how he dislikes blonde hair. I was taken aback at first, but whatever, everyone has a type I guess. Since then, any mention of a haircut or dye has been met with worried looks and “but I like long and brown”.  Easy enough, so I just let it grow out. 

Fast forward to present day: we both just graduated college and live together. I landed an awesome job working with children. In the midst of all the change, I decide I want to put purple highlights in my hair, just the pieces of hair that frame my face. To reach the color I want, I have to bleach the hair and tone it, so I’ve had blonde highlights for the last week. Predictably, A is not pleased.  When he first saw, he was visibly upset and asked why I would do that when I know he hates it.  Since then, he’s made comments everyday about how blonde my hair is, asking why I did it and asking when I will be doing something else to it. This morning, it reached the boiling point when A expressed how he felt it was unfair of me to “do this to him” because, in his words, hair is the only physical quality that is make or break in a relationship. He claims that he doesn’t care if my weight fluctuates, if my skin is broken out, or anything else, but said that out of respect I should dye my hair back, darker this time. He also says that he is finding it hard to be physically attracted to me with this change, because not only is blonde not attractive to him, but that my hair just looks downright bad. 

I feel like that’s fucking ridiculous. I’m an adult and should not have to ask my boyfriend for permission to dye my hair. I can understand him disliking it, but telling me that it’s disrespectful and blaming me for our lack of physical chemistry is asshole-ish.  I feel like if A were to shave his beard or get a buzz cut, I wouldn’t go out of my way to make it about myself.

My friend and I have known each other for over thirteen years- since we were little kids. We've had problems in the past with her behaviour when we were kids also, but I just have to play along and say ""yeah I don't know why I got so upset about that, lol"" even though I know I was justified in being upset. 

She constantly makes snide, judgemental comments about myself and my other friends that really makes me upset. Her comments can be about anything- appearance, demeanour, something I said, anything. They are completely unjustified and she just says things without any prompt from myself or others. 

For example, on multiple occasions, she has taken to insulting my skin. I can get pretty bad breakouts sometimes, and it's something I am very insecure about. I probably don't vocalize that as much as I should, but who really wants to tell people about their insecurities directly? Anyways, she will just stare at my face sometimes when I have a breakout (clearly on purpose, she never does it any other time) and it just makes me so uncomfortable. Even when I am feeling fairly good about my skin, she makes it a point to say something.

Recently, we got our school photos back during class and, totally unprompted, she told me my skin looked bad in my picture. When I finally got fed up and told her she was being rude, she was legitimately spluttering trying to cover up what she said.

She also has no regard for other people's feelings. She constantly will be late to events and hangouts she's invited to by 30 minutes to an hour and doesn't take responsibility for it, doesn't make an effort to remember names, and will tell you you're completely wrong about something without giving any reasoning in a rude way. 

I feel very guilty for resenting her for this and many other rude behaviours, but I really don't know if it's all just inside my head. Admittedly, I do question her (unrelated) actions sometimes in a joking way and we both laugh about it, but I don't know how she feels about that either.

This morning I went to Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee and ordered decaf.  I noticed that when employee #1 was making the coffee that they poured a pot with a black rim, typically indicating that the pot is regular coffee. When they handed me the coffee I asked again if it was decaf just to confirm (which is something I typically do every time I order due to my sensitivity) and employee #1 gave me a hesitant yes with a bit of an attitude. 

I wasn't convinced and didn't want to push back on employee #1 because of the attitude so I went down to the pick up area and told employee #2 that the first employee said that my coffee was decaf but I saw them pour it from a pot with a black rim.

I currently have a couple lifelong friends who are living in the main house.  I'm also engaged in a long distance relationship and my fiance's brother is living in the modular while he finishes school.  


The plan is when we get married to have her brother in the main house and my mother in the modular.  However, recently my friend's GF had been evicted from her previous place because her roommate just bailed on their lease.  While the drama was unfolding, I had mentioned that my friend's GF was being evicted to my fiance.    


Later that day friend asked me if his GF could stay in the house with him.  While I didn't like that if anything went south with their relationship it would be really troublesome, it didn't seem like she had another option.  Without consulting my long distance fiance I told him that she could stay with him (and I emphasized temporarily) while they look for a new place.  


However this is a pattern with me.  I had a different friend who moved in after their relatives needed them to move out.  My Fiance's brother is currently living in the modular because they didn't/couldn't pay rent and their landlord issued them an ultimatum to pay it that day or be evicted.  


I hadn't talked about it with my fiance until today (granted about a month has passed).  She gets extremely upset and declares the house as tainted and needing professionally cleaned before she moves in because another woman has lived there.  


While I should have talked to her about it prior (which is what I expected I was in trouble for).  Living around a college town, for me it's never been not normal for housemates to have GFs living with them.  However, my fiance is from a family/culture where men/women living together is extremely taboo.  However, I previously thought she didn't subscribe to that and we had lived together before we went to long distance.  


I would have shuffled my friend and his GF to the modular and my fiance's brother to the main house.  But my mom kept making it sound like she was moving in the very near future (which is when I have to find space in the main house for my fiance's brother)","False","Not the A-hole","4","24"

"ek187w","1578166491","AITA for not wanting to got family weddings","So this may take a little some pre-info, 

I'm indian(American, not a native), which unfortunately means weddings are not a 1 day affair but rather a week and some time more. On top of this, most elders in the Indian community, especially the Indian mothers, are particularly illogical, and tend take advice coming from half naked priests over facts/medical opinion/etc. 

Given that most Indian wedding also need to happen at a certain auspicious second. Meaning, some priest looks at the sky, has a tingle, and then determines the precise moment the marriage has to occur. This is mostly inarguable, and if there is a thing Indian people do better at staring, it is telling you ""I told you so"" after something goes bad, especially a marriage I would think.  

So here is the thing, the relatives are not in any third world country, they actually live in Europe, and as a result dont work for half the year.

Me on the other hand, I'm in my mid twenties, I work for a company which has traditional American viewpoints towards holidays and so thus I actually have do work for  most of the year. As a result, I must use my days off sparingly, and as I've put it before I don't see a need to waste my vacation days to go a wedding in a country I've been to almost every other year in adolescents especially where the main focus isn't me having fun. All my older siblings/cousins travelled the world, had fun and are now settling down. This is a path I want to follow, however not possible if I'm wasting my life going to these effen weddings, which I remind you, can take weeks and are usually planned on the most hipster of days like 13th of March. 

I've told my cousins older than me, that unless they have a wedding over the weekend in the US, there is no real way I'd be interested in coming as, like them, I'd also like to see other places. They don't understand, some have expressed that they may not feel the need to make my wedding etc.

This event happened this week.A little backstory: 2 of my cousins (both mid 20, females) were in a really good relationship with me and my sister (I'm 18 m). We live on the same street, so family meetups are quite common. They always ask me to order for them from ebay, or aliexpress, because they don't have a credit card.So Wednesday I went to watch the fireworks, and by the time I got home, I found my room in a mess. And money on my table. I asked my mom, what it was, and she told me, that my cousins came, and ordered from aliexpress by my card, and left the amount on my table. I legit lost my mind. It's not the fact that they used the card, it's that they had the audacity to search my room for it. I also have concerns, about the amount, but I can't check it, because they ordered it from their aliexpress accounts, so there's no way for me to check it, which makes me believe that they might have even saved my card info. When I told my mom about it, she said that they told me on messenger about this yesterday, which they didn't...This situation really makes me think that I can't really trust anyone. So I won't be hanging with them. I told my mom, that this didn't make me comfortable, that they can just enter my room and search my stuff for my bank card, without me knowing it. And she told me that I'm overreacting it, and that I they paid me back. I'm also concerned, that they saved the info, and might be ordering stuff in the future.

So I ask you Reddit, am I overreacting this situation?

"ek1di7","1578167129","AITA for playing podcasts during my morning routine?","Throwaway account (and on mobile sorry)

Anyway, I (F26) have been with my boyfriend (M27) of 4 years and we’ve been living together for 8-9 months now. We’re happy! Both work and pay bills equally and other than some small relationship bumps we’re fine.

I have a problem with silence sometimes. Depending on my “mood” I’ll require absolute silence or needing something to be going on in the background. It’ll also range from music to tv shows and podcasts. As long as there’s noise. But mostly it’s music and my boyfriend has had no problem with it since if he needs silence I can easily use headphones.

Sometimes though I do need to change it up a little since one of my “moods” gets me jittery and pent up with my music and I find all of it just dreadful to hear so I’ll put on a tv show I’m trying to catch up, the news, or a podcast.

Well lately (2-3 months) I’ve been in one of those funks to the extreme and all I’ve been listening to is podcasts. Mostly true crimes but some comedy ones too. I’ve been burning through them and it’s starting to upset my boyfriend.

Like I said earlier I need to have noise and I’ll bring these podcasts throughout my day. Specifically speaking he has a problem with me listening to them during my morning routine. I turn it on before I get in the shower and listen to it until I’m done getting ready for the day. It’ll come with me from the bathroom to the kitchen and until I get to work. If he’s also up I’ll turn it off so we can talk. 

He just has a problem with me listening to people talk when I’m in the shower. I shower every morning (I don’t wash my hair every morning) and I don’t think it’s a big deal but he’s saying it’s starting to get personal. It’s about how I’m having “men’s voices talk about gruesome murders while I’m in the shower” and he’s been jealous (?) about it. I don’t know how he’d feel about women’s voices since he never brought it up.

He especially hates it when it’s comedy podcasts so I try to avoid it. I don’t mind changing it to music for that certain time either since it’s just noise yet I think it’s ridiculous to be throwing a slight tantrum over it.  Like, we had a big argument a week back and he had brought it up. In the heat of the moment I told him he was being insecure child and bringing up irrelevant points to the argument and he then stormed off. 

It was one of our biggest arguments and he didn’t talk to me for a couple days.

I’ve since changed it to music to avoid any other confrontation and thought that was the end of it but when I was talking to a mutual friend of ours yesterday he had stated that I was being inconsiderate to his feelings and I’m being an ass for downplaying it like that. 

I have no clue since it’s done and over with but I’m feeling like maybe it is my fault and I shouldn’t have said he was an insecure child. AITA for not taking him more seriously?","False","Not the A-hole","7","29"

My friend (T) and I are mad each other for different reasons. He's mad at me presumably for talking to someone he does't like, and I'm mad at him because he's kinda a jerk. For context we're all still in high school

The main reason for this problem happened yesterday. Someone (who I will call F) started talking to me at a water fountain. T walks down the hallway, takes one look at F and starts walking the other direction. F is understandably offended by this, but me and her just start joking about it. The bell rings and we have to go to homeroom.

Flash forward to the end of the day, and F storms in visibly angry. T follows behind her, yelling about how he could ""get her in so much trouble"". F sits next to me and we start chatting, and from what I can gather T called her dumb when she confronted him about what happened. When I'm doing this, I glance over at T and he's glaring at me. He DMs me later, saying ""I knew I shouldn't trust you"" and about how horrible I am. But I don't respond, because I know what he's doing. He's done it with a couple other people. He'll just keep making the person angrier until they finally snap, then share that part of the conversation with his friends to make it look like the person's unreasonable. It's happened to a few of the people in my friend group.

I mentioned about how I think he's a jerk. Here's a couple of examples on why:

* When a friend asked if she could vent about her depression, he said yes but when she started talking about it T didn't take it seriously and asked if ""he could grab some popcorn for the show."" He then bragged about it to me the next day.
* Mocks people for no reason other than that they exist.
* Doesn't give me any space, and will say I'm being dumb if I ask him to stop following me around and that he isn't doing anything wrong.

My receptionist's husband was laid off sometime 2 years ago and they had really been struggling to provide for their family (she also supports her sick father). Around that time she had gotten pregnant and would be going off on maternity leave and practically begged me to hire her husband while she was gone on materrnity leave so that they would be able to provide for their family. I agreed to hire him in a different position, she came back and he is still working at the company too.

Her son is now 1 or 2 years old and has been having some complications (random seizures), and they have been in and out of hospitals sporadically in 2019 to try and find out what is wrong. What irks me the most is that when they call in sick they're both gone and they both don't show up to work when really only 1 person needs to be there to take care of their child, and it causes me grief as I have to move around responsibilities when the husband is off and move people from their regular positions to work the reception area when she is off.

Just last week she called in to say she wasn't going to be coming in as her son had another bad night, and of course her husband was not going to be coming in either. I told her no, I would not be accepting this any longer and that either her husband or herself would have to come in to work, I can not have them both off.

I am a 20 year old male, and most of the rest of the staff is older (30+). Recently, a new girl started working there around the same age as me and we became friends. I don't really talk much to the other staff because I'm younger and don't share much interests with them, so the people I do talk to are close to my age. One of my coworkers told my boss and other coworkers that the new girl and I are ""getting too close"" and she thinks something is going on between us.

&#x200B;

My boss (who I have a good relationship with) thought this was funny and he told me about what she had said. Apparently, when he heard her theory, he laughed it off and explained to her that I have a girlfriend and that I'm not generally the type to go around flirting with people. She defended herself by saying ""people cheat all the time"" and began ranting about how sexual harassment can occur in the workplace. My boss just shrugged it off because he knows me pretty well and tried to tell her that we probably just get along because we are similar in age.

&#x200B;

I was sort of upset that this coworker was trying to make stuff up about me. I barely know her and she definitely doesn't know me, and my boss said she was implying that my friendship with the new employee would lead to sexual harassment. So the next day, I told the only other young person there (who is also a close friend, let's call him John) about it all and asked him to play along and we made up a plan real quick. While we were working, I start having a very clear, sarcastic conversation with John, making sure that rumor-lady can hear me.

&#x200B;

Me: Hey John, do you think there's any secret workplace romances going on?  


John: I don't know, that seems like a pretty crazy accusation to make.  


Me: Oh you're right, we shouldn't be talking about these people who we barely speak to and accuse them of ridiculous things.  


John: But couldn't a secret romance lead to sexual harassment?  


The conversation went on, mostly just clarifying things we had already said, but I don't remember exactly how the rest went. Rumor-lady looked visibly upset. My boss called me into his office about an hour later and told me that although he found it quite funny, my coworkers said it was an uncomfortable situation and a few of them wrote complaints.

Before I adopted the young one the old one was NEVER interested in car rides, he hated them (still does) and now he only acts like he wants to go because the younger one is excited to go. 


At first I thought maybe he just didn’t realize how fun car rides are until the younger one showed him so I let him go a few times and... he absolutely LOATHED it. He was panting, growling, whining, and he throws up because he gets car sick. Basically he was exhausted, sick, and miserable. He couldn’t get comfortable and he runs back into the house as soon as we get home. I can’t even really put into words how much my old boy hates car rides but he really truly does.

Ill get to the point quickly; my coach frequently tells us that if we have a problem with playing time we as the players should speak to him about it.

When I first started I always played edgy catfolk rogues (pathfinder). Then I started always playing elven sorcerers, and recently I've been loving Barbarian Paladin hybrids. (5E)

Now when I played as my sorcerers I always hated how squishy I was, (but I loved my spell damage. When i could hit that is XD) and when I'd get upset after multiple turns of getting hit for high damage and nearly dying, id always be told that I should just have built my character more tankier.


So I started doing just that, I looked into all the different base classes and multiclassing rules. I realized that by taking 1 level in barbarian I could really give myself some good AC as long as my Dex and Con were high. And paladins are really great for healing and buffs. Thus my Barbarian Paladin hybrids were born.


Recently a friend wanted to run a big campaign.(5E homebrew story) Well one friend wanted to do point buy for stats, everyone else wanted to keep with the dice rolls (which we've all done for years. Both to our benefit and our downfall).



AC friend told my bf that the only way they'd be fine with dice rolls for stats was if bf ""helped"" me to not build a tank as tanky as I have (I usually get like a 21-22 AC MAX). Keep in mind AC friend isn't even the one DMing the campaign.


The issue with that is this, my whole role this campaign is the super protective paladin. Which would be a lot harder if I was easy to hit.


I brought this up to bf who then told me that other friend said it was assholish of me to be happy over a 20-22 AC and saying that I'm going to be fine in battle.


This coming from a person who always played murder hobos with similar AC and always, ALWAYS was cocky about their strength.


I know my bf isnt lying about this, as he genuinely wouldnt care about my characters having good AC or what as long as i wasn't cheating the game (which I have never done nor will ever do)


I only once ""bragged"" about my AC and that was about a character that wasn't even being used in a campaign with said person, and a lvl 20 character at that. I simply said that a certain homebrew class was fun to make because of the endless possibilities like high AC.

They like me but there's this issue with his brother. He's extremely dependent on my bf such as the rest of the family. The brother is constantly demanding a presence my bf doesn't want to give - in fact he can't be this present due to work. 

Just to be clear: I'm not demanding my bf to do something. He's tired aswell and it stresses him. I'm scared it gets worse by the time we live together.","1578171931.0","Not the A-hole","23","24"

"ek2dlr","1578171516","AITA for hiding several of my late grandfather's items when his sister asked for keepsakes?","My grandparents were never rich, but there were some things they splashed out on. This included their engagement/wedding rings, home appliances, and grandad's music. He loved playing and teaching us to play music, especially guitar, and the guitars that were left in the house range in value from approx £500 to £5000, and he also owned a couple of pianos in similar price ranges.

When he passed he left me the house and all of it's contents, minus a few items that he wanted given to certain relatives, and his brother (the executor of the will) and his lawyer offered to handle it for me, so I let them deal with that.

I was contacted by grandad's sister, who (by his admission) he had a rocky relationship with, where he put up with her solely because they're family. I have no details on it. I met her once when I was a kid and haven't seen her since but remember grandad venting to nan and me more than once about her.

The sister contacted me, said she was in town, and asked to come by the house. She said there were a few ""bits and bobs"" around the house that she'd like as keepsakes, and I knew there were photos of the two of them, some items belonging to their mother, and a few other things that held more sentimental than monetary value that grandad and his brother had each pointed out to me saying that once they got in touch with the sister they would give them to her.

Having only ever heard about the sister from grandad, and him having a less than amazing view of her, I decided to go to the house before she arrives, and put his guitars in the newly cleaned out attic. The rings are with my aunt and uncle so aside from the guitars the only other expensive items in the house were the large pianos and some appliances.

When she came by she said hi to me, we had a long talk as this was the first time I'd seen her since I was a kid, and then she picked out the photos, the broach, some cookbooks from their mother, and some sheet music grandad had written on. She did ask about the guitars, asking about one specific one she said she had bought for grandad when they were kids, and I said grandad put them in storage but I'd have a look and let her know, and she thanked me, gave me her contact info, and left it at that. When she was gone I put everything in the music room back how it was.

I got home and updated my husband on everything, and the first thing he said was ""dick move babe"". He then elaborated that he gets why I did it but clearly there was stuff grandad wanted her to have and if she was telling the truth then she only wanted one acoustic guitar, so it wouldn't have been the end of the world to let her into the music room and pick it out. I maintain that I had no way of knowing what she'd be like outside of what grandad told me, and while there were some things he wanted her to have, he never mentioned a guitar, and he never told me the story about her buying it for him.

&#x200B;

Background:  I (39M) am married to my wife (37F). We have a son (12M) and a daughter (7F). My son is in 7th grade, and my daughter is in 2nd grade.  My son is the main focus of this story.

&#x200B;

Over the winter break, my son was assigned a project in his social studies class. His teacher randomly assigned a country to each student (my son got Brazil). He had to create a poster on oak tag about the ""5 themes of geography"" related to that country. He had to use charts, graphs, images, and captions to explain each theme of geography. The project was due yesterday.

&#x200B;

Except for the fact that my son did not tell me any of this until New Year's Day. I was shocked that he would put off such a large project for so late. He is an good student (around 80%-85% range), and he has done this very few times before- but never for a project this big. He asked me if I could just do it for him.

&#x200B;

Now here's where my wife disagrees: I said yes to him. But first, I asked why he did this. He said that he just didn't feel like doing it over break. I made him promise that he would never wait until the last minute for a big project ever again, and he did. Then, I went out to the art store to buy some poster board, did a lot of research on Brazil, printed out some images and graphs. I typed up some captions for him, too.

&#x200B;

The next day (Jan 2), I had work, but when I got home, I finished gluing the printed work onto the oak tag. I let it dry, wrapped it up, and gave it to him in the morning yesterday when before went to school.

&#x200B;

When my wife found out that I was doing this, she got upset. She claims that I shouldn't have done the project for him because it teaches him that he can just be lazy and ask us to do schoolwork for him. I told her about the promise he made, but she said that it still teaches him bad habits for the rest of his school career. I'm not really sure. I know that he should've done the project earlier, but I didn't want to see my son fail the assignment when he has above-average grades and a relatively good track record.

Instead, I went into the account and changed the password and I've been watching some TV. I've given the login to a friend too.

I mentioned this to another friend and they think I've somehow wronged the person who's paying for it. I'm not sure, hence this post. Friend feels that this person's paying and I'm benefiting from it and that's wrong. I feel they're still happily using the set-top box and I'm just stealing from AT&T.

My wife just gave birth 2 months ago, and it went okay. God decided that my life was just a little too easy and decided to take me down a peg and so this happened to coincide with a week after my leg was amputated below the knee.

So not off to a great start with the kid obviously. Our apartment isn’t exactly crutches friendly. There seems to be a narrow doorway every 4 feet and the furniture is not exactly ideally arranged. 

I’m back at work now, I work a desk job so it hasn’t been impacted too much by my surgery. I’m working with my physical therapist to use a prosthetic but that hasn’t been going great. Still can’t walk with it.

My wife is going to be a stay at home mom until kindergarten starts. She has stopped breast feeding and wants me to start doing half the nights. My issue is that it takes me much longer to navigate the house and I can’t carry him. I can hold him sitting but not standing. So it requires a maneuver where I move one of the high chairs next to the sofa, take him out of the crib and put him on the sofa, transfer myself from the chair to the sofa, then pick him back up. Then I can use the ottoman and a towel to change him. Or feed him or whatever. 

This inevitably makes me lose quite a bit of sleep. I’m willing to do Fridays and Saturdays because I don’t have to wake up if she *really* needs, but would rather not.

It's been a tough few years for her, but contrary to her worrying, being her main emotional support hasn't drained me as much as she thinks. She regularly has low spells and struggles with day-to-day life. This seems irrelevant to the problem, but I think this is important context that may explain her behaviour.
	This argument has happened before many times, but it took the cake today. Long story short, we were watching a film, but it had to be paused while she made the dinner. I was texting a friend at the time, whom had typed up an entire monologue about their romantic life, so naturally I was distracted. When she got back, the movie timed out and it expired. She got angry and accused me of being selfish and texting my friend instead of prioritising the film. I apologised and tried to get it in an alternative way, but I failed. She then proceeded to get really angry. She called me an egocentric, self serving, typical teenager, and accused me of 'making a profession out of ruining her life'.

They have three German Shepherds, who all live in their one car garage. The dogs each live in wire kennels, with only enough room for them to stand or lay down. They never go on walks or run around the yard; they only get taken out to go to the bathroom briefly. We are in the Midwest, where temperatures can be extreme. I don’t think a garage is enough to protect the dogs from the temperature. It’s possible that the dogs are allowed in the house, but I’ve never seen them in there. The dogs bark CONSTANTLY. It’s very frustrating, as I am a college student who lives at home, and I do all my homework in my room (right next to the neighbors’ garage). The dogs, on the rare occasion that they’re allowed outside, are very aggressive. I don’t blame them; they’ve never been given the chance to socialize. Even if it’s not their fault, I find them very scary, and there are a lot of small kids in our neighborhood. My neighbors never yell at or physically harm their dogs, just are just apathetic towards them. I should note, in order to be transparent, that I am biased in this situation: I really dislike these neighbors, for reasons unrelated/irrelevant to this situation (but this situation doesn’t help). 

I had planned on reporting them, but my parents advised against it (as I said, I’m a college student who lives at home, and my parents are the homeowners). You see, the neighbors have a non-verbal, autistic, teenaged son,  who needs constant care. Even though it’s not his fault, he causes a lot of stress. Furthermore, their business tanked last year, and their other business ventures have been unsuccessful. Also, the husband’s mother was unfortunately murdered a few years ago, which was devastating. My parents say they already have so much going on that we should mind our own business. They said they’ll report them if they ever see them physically abusing the dogs, but since they’re not being physically harmed, animal control probably wouldn’t take them away anyway. Like I said, I’m no expert on dogs, so I don’t know what is considered abuse. I do know that those dogs live lonely lives, and it makes me angry.

As time has gone on, the extended family is more accepting of us, we are invite to and attend family gatherings and are all cordial but we don't socialise otherwise, with the exception of my now deceased grandma who loved my dad and mum and me and my sister had a wonderful relationship with her.

Previously it had been about 7 years since we had seen or spoken to my uncle. When my grandma died we went to her house to pay our respects - there was maybe about a dozen people there. My uncle said hello to us but other than that completely ignored us (we were all sitting around a table). After about an hour, my uncle looked at me and said ""you've really packed on the pounds, you used to be so pretty"" in front of everyone. I'd always been very slim (50kg) but having gotten a bit older I'd started to struggle to keep the weight off, been diagnosed with an automimmune disease which causes weight gain and a few months earlier I'd had an accident which left me bed ridden for 8 weeks so I couldn't work out. I knew I'd put on weight already and didn't need it pointed out. I became tearful and my mum, dad and sister started defending me but he didn't really see why that had been rude he just said ""but it's true, look at her"". No other comments were made after this.
Fast forward a year later to my grandfather's funeral. I've lost 20kgs, am on medication that helps regulate my metabolism and I'm now in a happy place with my weight. My uncle approaches me while I'm with my parents and sister and immediately says ""you look great, see all you needed was a bit of motivation"". I was furious that again, the only comment was about my weight and we were at a funeral service, so I calmly and pointedly said ""why are you so fascinated by my body?"" He was like a deer in the headlights, stuttered and walked away. My mum and dad didn't care that I said anything.
No-one else heard the conversation but later on my mum got a phone call from my uncle's wife saying I'd been disrespectful and insinuated he was a pervert. My mum would like me to apologise just to put the whole thing to bed but I just don't want to.

"ek37ah","1578175095","AITA for putting my former roommate/tenant's washer & dryer up for grabs and later calling the cops on him?","I (30m) had a friend of a friend (25m) rent a room from me over the summer. We agreed on a lease and things started smoothly. Before he moved out, he asked if he could keep his washer and dryer at my house since he was moving into a studio apt. I said I had no problem storing them for free. A week before he moved out, he said he was going to sell them instead.

He wasn’t a *bad* roommate/tenant, but in his last month he did things that rubbed me the wrong way (left the door unlocked one day, locked himself out and demanded I leave work to let him in, called multiple times asking I leave dinner with friends to help him change a tire so he doesn’t “get crushed”, etc.) so I looked up his post because my spidey-sense was tingling. As I guessed, he put my full address on Craigslist. I told him to delete it and relist with no address. When he handed over his key, we agreed since he no longer lived there that any sale would have to be on my schedule.

The next week, he said a couple was coming for the W&D. He listed them for $200 but I should try to ""talk them up"". I was annoyed he didn’t ask me first, but I was home so it worked out. I lugged the W&D to my driveway for easy access. They decided to pass on it after he told me they were definitely buying. He sent back a flurry of texts about how stupid and picky they were and ended with, “oh well. we’ll keep tryin”
I said I don’t mind storing them for free, but for selling them I’d like a commission. He was unfamiliar with that concept so I explained that to him. No response.

The next day, he says he borrowed a truck to pick them up at noon. I couldn’t respond until 4 pm. I apologized for being so busy, but the weekend would be better.  He said it would only be 20 minutes of my time, I should put them in my garage, give him the new door code, and he can pick them up from there without actually entering my house. He then told me he’d come Sunday at 6 pm get them. I had enough so I put them in my driveway and told him he could get them whenever he wanted. He quickly apologized and asked if I would take them back inside. I said no. The next morning, they were gone. He later texts me at work saying they aren’t there and asked if I moved them in. I told I don’t have them anymore.

I thought it was over, but next week he came by my house around 9 pm ringing the doorbell repeatedly. I heard him say he knows I’m inside and he did that stupid “housekeeping!” line in a high-pitched voice. I ignored, but he said he’ll be back later. He came back around 10:30 so I open the door with a shotgun, told him to leave, and shut/locked the door again. Either fearless or oblivious, that didn’t deter him. I called non-emergency dispatch and gave them a description, but he left before officers responded. Once they left, I let him know I contacted police and he isn’t welcome at my house again.

So a bit of backstory, I was out for dinner with my parents last night. When we left the restaurant, a homeless guy outside the was asking for money. 

My dad offered to buy him a meal at the restaurant we had been at. It was a nice gesture that I fully supported, and didn’t have an issue with. After buying the guy the food, he mentioned that his wife needed a coat. My parents went and bought his wife a $25 coat from a nearby store. Again, a good gesture maybe on the pricey side, but at the end of the day it was nice to see my parents being generous. However, in addition to the coat and food, they also gave the guy a $50 gift card to a nearby store. This is where I started to get bothered.

My parents often complain about finances.  I’m currently 17, and although I recently got a job, growing up I missed out on a lot of activities that my friends did since I didn’t have the money to participate, since I was too young to have a real job and my parents refused to give me money due to the finances reason I stated above. Some of these activities especially came to my mind, specifically when my parents refused to split the cost for a $15/ a month gym membership with me when I was gaining a lot of weight a couple years ago and wanted to improve my body. But then out of years of watching my parents give me little in the way of finances while I was growing up, I watch them spend $85 on a homeless guy they’ve known for 15 minutes. (Again, I wasn’t against them buying him food or anything, but I think spending $85 was pretty excessive).

Am I the asshole for judging my parents for doing this?

TL:DR, AITA for judging my middle class parents for spending $85 on a random homeless guy when they have cited our financial situation multiple times as the reason they couldn’t afford to help me financially with activities I wanted to do growing up.

I used to woke up around 5p.m. Yesterday, I asked my SO to wake me up at 2 p.m. I also put a lot of alarms. He did and the alarms worked, objective achieved.

He asked me if I wanted to be wake-up at an specific hour today, and I asked 1p.m (anytime in the 12-4 range would have been ok to me, but he likes precise instructions). I also put on alarms. Well, nothing worked because I woke up at 20.30p.m, feeling shitty about the darkness, the day lost, and still living in nightshift.

Basically, I was in a local cafe the other day.  Sitting working on some work for my university studies, minding my own business.  

I have my headphones in (noise cancelling) so I’m pretty oblivious to what’s going on.  Out of nowhere, a kid (10/11 max) must’ve fallen and the mug goes flying, yup, you guessed it, into my laptop, cracking the screen and completely destroying it.  

I only recently just bought the new laptop, it’s a MacBook Pro and I got it with Xmas money and some other money I had saved from working part time. It was my dream laptop and something I worked so hard to get. I didn’t get AppleCare or anything as I’m generally pretty careful with everything, to this point I’ve never broke anything before.

The parent of the child came over, checked obviously that they were alright (same as me). They notice that my Mac is completely done.  The parent explains that it was a freak accident and he’s sorry etc (at this point the child is crying hysterically).  I explain that I’m glad the boy is ok, but at the end of the day I was sitting here minding my own business and I’m at a great loss through no fault of my own.  He shrugs and says “what do you expect me to do? Pay for a new laptop for you?”

At this point he leaves the cafe with his son in a hurry, no further conversation with me and everyone is pretty shocked.  Luckily, I was able to get his contact information as someone in the cafe knew both of them as friends of a friend.

Everything went down on NYE when me, said friend, and a group of about 4 others were all watching TV and enjoying the holiday in my apartment. We got some light-up balloons as well to make it more festive and were passing one of them back and forth when someone accidentally hits it too high and it touches the ceiling. Mind you, I have both a popcorn ceiling and very thin walls between me and my neighbors. The balloon popped and it was pretty loud so I just said “hey let’s just not toss balloons around anymore, that was too loud and I don’t want to make my neighbors angry”

Five minutes goes by and said friend has a balloon in his hands and is messing around with it. Another member of the group begins to jokingly egg him on to throw it against the ceiling again. I look said friend directly and the eye and tell him multiple times not to, that I don’t want to bother my neighbors or get in trouble, please don’t do it. So... of course he does it. I get pissed off and yell at him and get pretty harsh, which is why I might be the asshole. What I yelled word for word was “What the f***, why would you do that? If you do it again, I’m going to f***ing kick you out”. Yeah, pretty harsh, I know. Not that it’s any excuse also, but I was pretty drunk at the time. Four days have passed since then, and he has not spoken a SINGLE word to neither me nor anyone in the friend group. I have now apologized 3 times, twice right after it happened (both in person and over text), and just now about an hour ago, to which he has left me on read. At this point the whole friend group feels very awkward about everything and no one is really speaking to each other. What do you guys have to say?

When she moved in, she brought her emotional support cat, Ash (7F). I love cats, so this was fine by me. A couple months later, she invited me to go see some kittens that her friend's barn cat had. With my sister's blessing and a week of thinking it over, I took one home and named him Nox.

Ash had been freefed for the time my sister has had her (got her from the humane society about a year ago). They are both now schedule fed because Nox is a little vacuum cleaner. She was a little pudgy, but has lost a significant amount of weight since Nox got here. My sister feeds Ash at night, and whatever she doesn't eat gets covered for when she is hungry later. I feed Nox at night and in the morning, but intend to switch to my sister's schedule when he is a year old. Sometimes I feed Ash at night for my sister if she's in the middle of a game.

My sister has insisted that Ash has a crying problem. She meows when she's hungry, wants attention, wants to get in a door, you just look at her, etc. My sister has trained her to give kisses for affection now, but that's it so far.

This morning Ash was crying at my sisters door for a half hour, wanting to get in for food. I let her in. Sis then comes out, annoyed that I woke her up, and asked if I let Ash in her room. I said I did because she was hungry and since Sis was asleep, must not have heard her crying. Sis grumbled and just went into the bathroom. So I went into her room, grabbed the bowl, brought Ash into my room and locked Nox out so she could eat in peace.

I then get a knock on my door asking if I was feeding Ash. I said, ""Yes, she's hungry."" Well, sis was upset that I fed her and said, ""Well I guess we just let her have what she wants now when she cries?"" Her plan for training Ash not to cry is to ignore whatever she wants until she stops, and then give it to her. 

I feel like cats (no offense) are not smart enough to get that. I also feel like since she used to be freefed, she should have access to her food whenever she wants it. Another part of me feels like it's neglect not to feed her cat when she's crying. I know that a cat isn't a kid, but if you withheld food from a kid like that, you'd get CPS called on you.

I’m on Christmas break right now and I want to know if I’m just being dramatic about this. 

I have my own apartment in college, and my parents have an apartment about an hour and a half away from me. When school isn’t in session, I stay with them. Since I’ve moved out, they’ve replaced my bed with one for my dad. I no longer have anywhere to sleep so I sleep on the couch. I keep my hamster in my old room while I’m there and my parents keep leaving the door open- it upsets me because I don’t want our cats getting to her and scaring her. 


I’ve tried to keep my room clean because they insist it’s still my room, but it doesn’t feel like mine because my mom put my old TV in her room, I have no bed in there, and the only reason I go in there is to spend time with my hammy. However, my dad and one of our cats constantly make a mess of it and I’m stuck cleaning it because it’s “my room”. 


On top of this, I have zero privacy while I’m here.  My dad works from 1pm to 10pm and stays awake in the living room, where I sleep, until about 1am. I go to sleep at around 2am.

My boyfriend's (22M) parents thought it would be a nice idea to meet my parents since they've never met. My parents got divorced about 13 years ago and aren't on great terms but can be civil with each other if needed.
My mum got together with a guy (we'll call him D) a year and 3 months ago (they've already broken up once and got back together during that time) and since I don't live near them I've only met him 3 times. Apparently all 3 times I've managed to offend him for the stupidest reasons. For example, he was really offended that I didn't offer to buy him a drink after he bought me one. The reason I didn't offer was because I couldn't afford it (he was already aware that I had no money) and if he'd have accepted the offer then I'd have had to say no anyway.

About a week ago I went to see my mum to show her my baby scan since I've not seen her since I found out about my pregnancy and D happened to be at her house (apparently they practically live together now) and I mentioned her meeting my boyfriend's parents. Nothing was said at the time but I got a call off my mum saying that I had offended D by implying that he wasn't invited and I told her straight that he wasn't invited. It was so the grandparents of my baby could meet each other before the birth and since I barely know him and he won't be her grandad then he wasn't invited. My mum said she understood that but that she wanted support to which I replied that I would be there so she would have support. She then said she didn't want to make the drive alone, I suggested she could bring my brother with her if she wanted to. She kept trying to make excuses as to why D should be invited and then said she would let me think about it and to let her know what my decision is.

So my question is, would I be the asshole if I still told her she couldn't bring her boyfriend?
I understand her wanting support but I've already agreed to have my parents meet my boyfriend's separately so that there's no awkwardness and have said she's more than welcome to bring my brother as support. I just don't particularly see why it needs to be her boyfriend that I barely know.

(context: me and my boyfriend have only been together for just over 6 months and only found out I was pregnant on Christmas eve, obviously with me being as far along as I am, neither of us felt comfortable aborting so we've decided to keep her and I'm moving in with his family)","False","Not the A-hole","10","18"

Instead of apologizing for her mistake, she drove off with my dad’s permission claiming she was late for plans, which is quite shitty.

I asked whether or not she could call insurance and flipped at the idea claiming her rates would skyrocket. Regardless, my car needs to be fixed and I should not be the one paying for it.

My sister makes a decent living but is absolutely terrible with money. She doesn’t even pay rent in my parents house so there really isn’t a reason why she can’t pay me back for the damage within the next month before I return to university. However, I have loaned her money before and she is very unreliable in paying it back. I don’t have faith in paying for it myself and then having her pay me back in the future. I also fear that if I wait to fix the damages, she is not going to pay.

However, she keeps refusing and since I have no authority over her, I asked my parents to get involved. My dad, who is not confrontational, got extremely mad that my mother got involved. She started threatening to get insurance involved if she didn’t offer a plan to pay for the damages. My dad claims that he just wanted to keep the peace, and snapped at my mother and now they are not talking and I am eating alone at the dinner table feeling like I am a piece of shit.

"ek3sfs","1578177748","WIBTA for wearing my wedding dress to my cousin's wedding?","When my wife and I met I was wearing a vintage style knee length navy dress.  [This isn't the exact dress but it looks similar to this.](https://www.lindybop.co.uk/vicki-navy-blue-swing-dress.html)

When my wife and I got married we didn't want a big white wedding for a few reasons. We eventually decided to wear the clothes we were wearing when we first met, and went with a tiny wedding, of exactly 11 people. Attendees were my son, my mother, my brother, our 4 best friends, and my wife's uncle and his husband, and us. We announced our marriage to everyone else by posting some pictures on facebook at the time (3 years ago). To this day the dress is my favourite piece of clothing that I own and I still wear it all the time.

I got back in touch with my dad after the wedding. My cousin on dad's side is getting married tomorrow. The theme is Romeo & Juliet. She's got this colour scheme going where her guests wear blue and his wear red. I don't fully understand it but she says it's going to look great in the photos, and everyone attending needs to stick to their assigned colour. I had a blue dress picked out and ready to go but my son spilled an actimel on it (total accident). It's in the wash but it's not going to be dry in time.

I don't have any smart clothing on hand that I could wear and still be in accordance with the dress code.

I put the first dress in the wash, told my wife what happened, and asked if I could borrow one of her pantsuits. It didn't fit so I then turned to my wedding dress. My wife said she wasn't sure wearing my wedding dress would be a good idea, and that tomorrow we'd go looking for another.

I responded that the wedding starts at 12 and is an hour drive away without traffic, and the shops don't open until 10, so we'll be diving about last minute and I'm worried about the logistics of buying the outfit less than 2 hours before the wedding starts. She replied that I should ask my cousin but as this is the night before her wedding and she's currently on her bachelorette, I don't want to bother her right now.

The last thing I want to do is be that bitch who wore her wedding dress to her cousin's wedding, but the way I see it is I wasn't in touch with my dad's family when we got married, I wear this dress all the time, and the only people who know I got married in this and will also be at the wedding tomorrow are me, my wife, and my brother, and none of us intend to tell people. It's not a big white ballgown like she'll be wearing, it's a knee length navy dress without a stitch of white on it. However, my wife is saying that *we* know the significance and if someone remembers the pictures then I *will* be that bitch who wore her wedding dress to her cousin's wedding.

With this in mind I am turning to this forum. If I am TA then I will go to the high street as soon as the shops open tomorrow and get another dress, if not then I'll just wear this one.

"ek3x2e","1578178321","WIBTA for confronting my brother","Edited to fit word count. Ask for details in comments. 

So my brother has always been kind of a quiet to himself type of guy. Not terribly social. But lately he’s been non-existent in our lives (there are 5 kids all together) and it kind of all started when he met his current wife. His wife was one of my closest friends from high school. For a while he was fine. But you could tell there was some distancing and distaste starting towards our family. Not specifically me, however the friendship kind of faded really fast after that. 

once they got married he just dropped off the face of the planet. He was already starting too but now we never saw him. He wouldn’t come to family lunch,would never reach out or respond. Would not come to game nights or most holidays. I remember one year he broke my moms heart because he didn’t even stop by on thanksgiving even though both their families were in the area. 

So once my parents moved that’s when I felt things kinda just took a nose dive. I wanted to gather all the siblings together to talk about things and make a plan for sticking together now that Sunday lunches weren’t a thing. I told him specifically it was siblings only. I kicked my husband out for an evening because of this. There were sensitive things we wanted to talk about that even if he was okay with, other siblings wouldn’t be okay with in front of spouses. He brought her. This is where I’m the asshole 100%. I realized it, admit it and moved passed it. When I opened the door I said sarcastically “hey it was supposed to be siblings only” about 2 seconds after I said it (and made people very very mad) I realized I was pretty dumb. 

I apologized the next day (as soon as he would let me or talk to me) and explained it all. I explained why it was a sensitive topic and why it was siblings only. I had thought we had come to some kind of terms with this. I told him we were planing game nights and wanted to see him and his wife and that we didn’t want to lose touch. I thought that was that and it was all good. This was like over a year and a half ago. They seemed to respond well to this. And agreed with what I was saying. 

nothing changed. He doesn’t talk to us, they don’t visit or call or text. They only come for Christmas.last year (2018) they completely excluded my sister for New Years. they invited all siblings except for her. They, quite frankly, act like then do not like us or it’s a burden to be around us. (Mostly seems like his wife is like this) it’s exhausting trying to reach out and show we care. 

recently we got some really awful family news that made me realize, what if something were to happen to any of us? Would he even get the message? Would we know if something happened to him? So I’ve been thinking about getting him to sit down and talk. To tell him how much he has hurt us;how badly we want him to be a part of our lives. Me and my sister have kids. It would be awesome if they knew their uncle. 

So WIBTA if I confronted him.","False","No A-holes here","5","42"

With my BF for almost 2 yrs. Recently, We discussed getting my 1st tattoo as I’d always wanted but never got any while BF has many. Bit of backstory I want to include is that he thinks couples who get matching ones are crazy and he would never let someone get his name tattooed or vice versa. So I thought getting a fake of his name would be a hilarious and harmless joke. Months ago he had fake proposed to me, so I thought this was fine. I liked the way it looked and was excited to show him. Well he didn’t freak out, he loved it and kept asking to see and take pictures. Despite admitting it was “a little much”, his reaction was pretty underwhelming and there was doubt. I decided I had to double down and convince him but he seemed to question it still. We were visiting his family for the holidays so I gave up and decided to tell him after we left. Something you should know about BF: He has habit of ghosting when he gets upset. He gets quiet and withdrawn, when I’m not there he ignores calls or texts back short responses hours later. This is unlike his normally clingy personality and I don’t like or understand it, but everyone has their own way.
It would go on for a day or weekend, every few weeks. Now it happens almost each week and for 2-4 days over the smallest thing. I used to respond terribly as I would overthink and stress myself w assumptions. Id call and text or show up as many times as it took. Now I try to be patient and calm bc I’ve explained to him how worried it makes me when I don’t know why or whats wrong. I remind him that I respect his space but I need him to communicate if he needs it. Or I constantly doubt myself bc he denies being cold or that anything is wrong at all. I understand it isn’t personal, this is just how he is. So when I told him the truth, explained my thoughts and apologized, his reaction was minimal. He said he obviously knew the whole time and got quiet the rest of the drive home. I didn’t get why hed suddenly shut down if the tattoo wasn’t the issue. By now Ik when he does this there’s nothing I can do but wait. Until after 3 days of shunning he admitted he hadn’t known and that he felt stupid for believing I’d “prove my love”. I couldn’t discuss a solution or any conclusion as he’s still on “shut down”. I’m on Day5 and it’d only been 4 days since the last time he ghosted while I was away on a family Xmas trip for a week. This time, I feel I fucked up and he deserves his peace if I’ve hurt him. That doesn’t stop me from noticing I’ve been trying to jump the same hurdle for a year.","False","Everyone Sucks","5","26"
"ek3z80","1578178597","AITA for not letting my MIL and her sisters play a song at our wedding?","So, my wedding was a week ago and I’m still hearing about this “horrible thing” I’ve done. I need some final closure on it before I break somebody.

My MIL and her sisters have “a song” that they play and dance to at every family wedding without fail. I don’t know the name of it, it’s some deep water rap song from the 80’s or 90’s and every other word is a cuss word. It talks about graphic sex and drug use and I hate it. I’m not into music like that, and neither is my fiancé, but he doesn’t say anything to her about it. I made sure to put it on our “do not play list” for the DJ to double check that we wouldn’t be hearing it.

My MIL and her sisters run to the DJ about half way through and ask him to play it. He tells her no, as it’s on our DNP list. She comes over to me and asks why I would do that. I told her that the lyrics weren’t appropriate as I didn’t want my young cousins/siblings and my super Christian grandmother to have to hear it. Her and her sisters told me it wasn’t fair to them, and that they always play it and I don’t have the right to cancel their tradition. I told them I wasn’t going to argue with them at my wedding and that we could fight about it in the morning if it was so important. They sat down and didn’t dance for the rest of the night.

The only reason I feel bad is because we played other songs with swear words, but none nearly as graphic as the one they wanted. And, it ruined the rest of their night because they were upset.

However, I have gotten texts nearly 24/7 from them since the wedding saying stuff like if I wanted to be accepted into their family I needed to accept them, and I have no right since the wedding isn’t just for me and my husband but for everyone else to celebrate too, etc. Finally today I told them that if they texted me again without apologizing for harassing me this past week, that they would not be welcome to stay with us in our home again. They haven’t responded nor have they contacted my husband. He seems to think I overreacted by not letting them play the song, but says they are in the wrong simply because they haven’t left me alone about it.

So, give it to me straight: AITA for not letting them play the song?

My mother and father have been divorced for about a year now and I've had a rocky relationship with him, to say the least. He has been trying to work on our relationship and I feel in some capacity it has improved but that's not the main issue.

In a week he will be leaving to go to another country for about 3 months while he fixes up an old family home there on his own. He just so happens to be leaving on the same day that I have a math presentation that I have been working on for 3 months with my group as it is the big final project worth about 20% of my grade. He called me today about going with him to the airport with him as he really wants that to be the last time I said goodbye to him before he leaves. I informed him that I wouldn't be able to because of the time for the presentation and his departure happen at basically the same time and thus I would not be able to go. I asked him if he would be open to sleeping over at the house we live at know or even myself going over to his house to sleep over and say goodbye to him the morning he left. He then proceeded to place all blame on me as if it was all my fault I couldn't see him off at the airport and how I was awful for essentially leaving him alone at the airport and how I was a horrible son to put my education above family.

This just happened recently so sorry if I'm babbling but I just really need to get this off my chest but in the end, I still feel kinda conflicted about this. I get that he is really sad I can't see him off at the airport but at the same time, I'm sorta hurt that he thinks that I had any control in this situation and that I should feel guilty that I don't wanna fail my own course.

"ek41k1","1578178888","AITA for still wanting to move out-of-state after my dad died?","So, I'm 22 and unemployed. While I was looking for jobs after college, a month after I graduated, my father passed away suddenly. Ever since then, it's kind of been my full time job caring for my mom and the house -- taking care of her dogs, fixing things up, running errands, etc.

It's been like this for around six months. My mom is now telling me that I need to get a job and move out -- which is very true. Before my father died, it was my dream to live out of the country for a while. My mother has never liked the idea, but especially now -- whenever I bring up moving anywhere that's not within a 20 mile radius -- she gets very upset. She tells me, ""I'm sorry that you think the only way to be successful is moving far away from me."" I just want to experience living somewhere other than the city I grew up in.

I do really want to move, just because it's always been my dream to see the world. I also think distance will improve my relationship with my mother. I don't want to say she's ""abusive"", but she's frequently belittling and mean-spirited about my interests and lifestyle. Living far away would lessen the opportunity for confrontation. 

But, at the same time, I don't know what she's going to do by herself, especially without my father to take care of her. She doesn't have a lot of life skills; I'm the one who figures out the bills, house repair, etc. I think she's fully capable of learning these things (she's not that old), but I still fear being far away, just in case she does need my help. I also feel terrible for leaving her alone.

Despite this, I reached the decision the other day that I'm going to try to get a job abroad, or at least job search in different cities. When I told my mother, she cried and refused to talk to me, once again saying that she ""doesn't understand why I hate her so much"". She hasn't spoken to me since for anything other than necessities since, even when I try to explain my POV. I know that she loves me and will miss me, and is only acting like this because she loves me, but I still very much want to experience life beyond our small town.

I have a son with my ex wife. We got divorced when he was around the age of 11 ( he is now 16 ). I cheated with another women and she didn’t really managed to “fulfill” me. We aren’t exactly friends but we don’t hate each other. In the other hand, my relationship with my son has worsen since our divorced. He is very distant to me, he seems more close to his mom boyfriend than to me. And it got to the point in which I kinda gave up. I had him each other weekend, at first we went out to see movies or to visit his grandparents. But recently I have seen how he doesn’t seem to care. He doesn’t really want to visit me and there had been a couple of weekends in which he simply decided to not visit me.

So, basically a couple of weeks before Christmas I was planning with his mother what we would do in Christmas and new year. We decided thta j was going to get him in New year and her in Christmas. Out of curiosity I asked her what she was going to gift our son. Apparently because he has been a very good student this last years she decided to buy him a new and better PC ( my son loves videogames and apparently he complained about his computer not being good enough for playing those games ). And this PC wasn’t cheap. I don’t remember how much did it cost but it was considerably expensive. I told her that it was too much money for a gift to a kid. And this started an argument. Like I said, she makes more money than me and thus her gifts are more expensive than mines ( for example a couple of years she bought him a ps4 ). 

My problems with this are two. 1: I don’t want my kid to be a spoiled kid, sure he has been good at school but he hasn’t really worked for it, not even in a symbolic way. I’m afraid that he will believe that his mother will buy him all he wants without working. 2: This is also something bad for my relationship with my kid. Like I said, I don’t have a good relationship with him but I’m trying to fix it. And her giving him these kind of gifts will only reinforce the idea of her being a better parent than me.

Unfortunately, she gift it anyways and the relationship with my son is still bad. I’m very angry at her about this, but maybe I’m wrong? I have been trying to think about recently and I have still not got to a conclusion.","False","Asshole","4","116"

Because of her credit history i decided i would get a second line on my bill so she would have a phone. We dated for about 2 years and in that entire time never once paid for any of the phone bill.

When we broke up i told her that if she paid the phone bill she could keep the phone. I gave her some leniency for the first couple months, reminding her everytime the bill came in how much she owed me for it. Every month she had a different excuse about why she couldnt pay me but promised to pay me next time.

Before the third bill came in i suggested that she give me the phone back if she cant afford to pay it. Her response to that was that the phone was a gift and therefore belongs to her (it wasnt a gift, i never once hinted or implied that it was). When it got into the fourth month with no previous payments i told her that i would cut the phone off if she didnt pay me soon. She went on a big rant about how she wont be able to find work or do anything without it so i felt bad and decided to wait a bit more.

Finally during christmas break i decided i have had enough. I waited until the end of december and called my phone company to report a stolen phone and cut it off. Its been about a week since then and one of our mutual friends is now telling me what she and her friends are saying about it. Apparently i am a piece of shit and ruining her life by doing this.

I have had a few mixed responses about it so i wanted to ask here. Am i the asshole for reporting a phone on my bill as stolen after 7 months of no attempt to make a payement?

Edit:I guess i forgot a detail in there. This was the second phone i got her, the first one was a gift and i told her that but i was specific with the second one that she would be expected to pay the bill as soon as we got it and if she didnt pay the bill the phone would still be mine and she would be simply borrowing it.

It is technically only been reported as lost/stolen because that is the only way to cut off the phone usage with this company (excluding cancelling the plan and paying $600 still owed for the device) so i havent actually made the claim yet merely cut it off and flagged it so it cannot be used","1578183643.0","Not the A-hole","210","156"
"ek4m0w","1578181452","AITA for not wanting to stay in touch with my mother","So basically my parents divorced when I was 4 years old. During that time when my dad wanted to leave her she asked him if he wanted to take me with him (she didn't want me because I am a boy) and without any hesitation my dad said yes. During that time with my dad I visited my mother a couple of times to see my sisters. Suddenly she wanted to convince my dad to ""try it again with her because of the kids"". Btw she cheated on my dad (one of the reasons for the divorce). My dad denied that offer with a great smile and said ""you didn't want bnggzt5.  Now you want him all of a sudden?"". He said that he would never try again after the things she did and I am so glad he made this decission. Now I am 16 years old and my mum begged my dad for my phone-number. He gave it to her with my agreement and now all of a sudden she wants to contact me again. In the past 12 years she ignored me and pretended I wasn't there. Of Course she sometimes asked if I wanted to come over but only because she had a friend over and wanted to be the ""good mother"". I denied all of her attempts of convincing me to go back to her. She even accused my dad and my grandmother of not letting me to her. (My dad often asked me if I wanted to go and I said no). She has no idea of how much she hurt me. I almost wasn't able to make it to the ""Realschule"" (it's the school in Germany after the middle school). Because of the sadness i wasnt really able to learn because all I could think of was that B****. She just hurt me that bad that I just don't want to know her anymore. *she is dead to me*

I chose ti do this as she has always held a negative opinion on them and would often belitle me every time i said i wanted one. Her favourite thing to do is comment on how disgusting/ trampy they are.

So NYE whilst cutting the tag out of my dress she saw it (it's right on the top of my spine) and flipped at me about how I was a tramp, dickhead... etc and claiming that I have no respect for her and me and my dad (who found out earlier in the year and was also disappointed in me) are conspiring against her and how he always takes my side.

"ek4mmm","1578181525","AITA for offering my neighbor a dessert her kid cannot eat?","I got a bottle of rum left from New Year party and I'm not a drinker, so I decided to make a dessert called envinado that is kind of like a cake but it's drenched in a syrope made of sugar, rum and fruits.

I decided to give some to my neighbors. One of my neighbors is a young woman around my age (I'm also a girl) and she has a 4 years old kid. So she opened the door with her kid and as soon as he saw the envinado the kid started crying about wanting cake. I explained to the mom that it was not cake, it was envinado and it had a lot of rum so her kid couldnt eat it.

She got mad at me and rudely told me that I should have brought something that her kid couldn't eat because now she'll have to deal with a screaming kid all afternoon.

When that just happened I was convinced I did nothing wrong so I posted a rant here on Reddit on another sub (that was later delete because I was told that it didn't fit the sub). But before it was deleted I had like 18 comments and like 15 of those were telling me it was my fault. That I shouldn't have brought something that her kid couldn't eat and that dealing with screaming kids was the worse.

So now I'm wondering was I the asshole here?

Edit 1: English is hard and I said his when I meant to say her.

Edit 2: I don't think you are understanding how much alcohol there is in the envinado. Going by my grandma's recipe. You bake the cake. You made a syrope with a little water, tons of sugar and fruits. Then you mix the syrope with the bottle of rum. And you drench the cake in the syrope+rum mix. It doesn't have a tiny bit of rum. It's dripping rum+syrope.

Edit 3: Just to clarify, I didn't try to give her the whole envinado. I shared it with several of my neighbors. I didn't showed with a full envinado to her house. It was more like a huge slice. I didn't make the envinado with the intention of giving it to her. I made envinado with the intention of using that bottle of rum for something tasty and then I decided to share it with my neighbors. I kept like 1/4 of that envinado.","1578245755.0","Not the A-hole","231","199"
"ek4n5a","1578181589","AITA for not speaking to my sister anymore","My (19M) younger sister (18F) started dating my at the time best friend  Tony 19M back in 2018. Tony and I had been best friends since we were 10. I wasn't thrilled when they started dating, if I can be honest. But, they are their own people and don't require my permission to date. It stopped being so awkward after a while. 

In October they broke up after my sister caught Tony cheating on her. She was devastated, and I was pissed at him and also really disappointed. I've never known Tony to have cheated on someone, and I hold cheaters in low regard. I had an argument with Tony about it, told him his actions disgusted me, and that I didn't want to speak to him again. I 100% stood by my sister because a) she was the wronged party and b) she was my sister. 

Well, I just found out that my sister also cheated on Tony during their relationship, including with the guy she's almost dating now. I have never been madder at my sister than I am right now. I completely took her side, I cut off my best friend of almost a decade while the whole time she knew she was doing the same thing. At no point did she even try to stop me from cutting off Tony, she just let me be under the impression that Tony was the only bad guy. And on NYE she even introduced me to her new almost boyfriend, that she was cheating on Tony with. IDK why that also makes me mad but it does. 

I feel like I've manipulated into losing my best friend. As such I'm not speaking to my sister right now. She was invited to a party tonight to celebrate my gf's birthday and I uninvited. She called my gf crying about being uninvited, and my gf said it was months ago and it wasn't my relationship, so I shouldnt be this upset - and that either way I should have my sister's back because she's my sister and Tony cheater on her. And then my gf told me it's her party and her guests and she wants my sister there. I told her if she invites my sister I'm not coming, and as such I'm not going.

"ek4sti","1578182335","AITA for calling the dog a malingerer?","My family’s dog is cute, and fun, but she’s also a huge drama queen. She has made up limps to get attention or to get us to carry her on walks. Beyond that, her pain tolerance is zero, her discomfort tolerance is zero. I didn’t think it would be offensive to mention these behaviors, since she’s a dog and really not capable of getting offended by such a mention. She has gotten sick before (Lyme disease and bladder stones) but both of those times it was incredibly obvious that she was sick as opposed to faking. 

This morning she threw up on the bed, and was having trouble walking during her walk. My Dad said it seemed like she had a limp, or maybe her paws were hurting, or maybe her joints were stiff...All of those things, all at different times. My Dad, who treats this dog like a princess baby, was freaking out about this all day, thinking that she was dying. He said my Mom should take her to the emergency vet, which my Mom refused to do, since it’s expensive and she thought the dog was fine. The dog hates going on walks in the rain and getting wet and my Mom thought this might be the issue. 

I walked up the stairs and the dog ran up to me, giving me her ball. I threw it and she ran across the room and got it. I saw that she was favoring one leg, nothing too bad. I went to the kitchen and she got up on two legs to beg me for a bit of food. I gave her a treat which she ate. I thought all of this seemed normal. I walked into the living room and my Dad said, “She looks like she’s in so much pain.” 

I said, big mistake sentence, “I don’t know...you know she’s a bit of a malingerer, right?”

This absolutely set him off. He started yelling at me about it, saying “I know what it looks like when she’s faking she’s not faking” and “she could barely move this morning and you’re trying to minimize her pain.” 

I said, “Don’t yell at me like that, it’s really rude.” He said “I‘ll talk to you any way I want.” I tried to explain that we’re all concerned but she seems fine now, and if he’s upset about it and acting unusual, she will feed off that energy. But he put on headphones and started blasting music, saying “Sorry I can’t hear you!!!”

I went over to talk to my Mom about this. She asked me “why do you start arguments like that?” I didn’t think I was starting an argument, he’s even joked about her tendency to limp around before to get attention. My Mom said, “You’re dismissing the dog, that’s why he’s upset.” 

I didn’t think I was being an asshole or rude by calling her a malingerer.

She was given £90 as Christmas money but she says it’s been stolen by someone in her family.
My friend comes from a low income background. She has 3 sisters and her mum cannot work. She also doesn’t have a dad. She doesn’t work during the semester (she has a job at the town she’s from but only works there when she’s visiting her family - so not very often, and it pays minimum wage) She relies on student loans to pay for rent and food. However I come from a middle class background, my parents are still together and I have a well paying job (for a teenager). I have a lot more money than her.

I want to give her the £90 because she needs it more than I do but she won’t let me because she said she would feel guilty and she’s more upset that a family member stole it. I don’t think she would be angry at me for not understanding that she cares more that it was family, I’m worried that she will feel guilty and try to return it to me (sneak it into my bag or something) 

I have a plan to hide it somewhere in her room and then once I go home I would message her and say “look under your pillow I left something for you” next week but I don’t know if she would be upset. I would feel guilty to see her struggle and go without when I could give her the £90 and not really miss it.

My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.

I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.

Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.

My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?

My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.

He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.

I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.

Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.

And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.

Edit.

I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.

1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.
2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.
3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.
4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.
5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.
6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.
7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.

He never showed me any vulnerability until now. I said he’s doing great but he said he didn’t think so. He talked about not having a good job and pretty much being a virgin. I said he has a good job for a new graduate. 


He said God put him in this world to become a singer, but he never had the balls to get out there. He’s shy. I told him even though he’s a great singer, that’s not really a realistic career because it’s a crapshoot who makes it. He sulked some more about being an accountant and not having sex in 3 years. I never talked to him about his relationship and sex history. He said he had a “girlfriend” for 3 weeks and had sex with her a few times and another casual sex with someone he met at a party once. I asked him about them and he described them as short, skinny, and Asian.


I asked him what type of women he likes. He described his ideal type as 5’7”, 100 lbs, white or ABG with fake boobs. He went into great detail why he likes fake boobs. The Asian girl he had casual sex with was a freshman with fake boobs. I asked him if he was down for other type of women and he said they had to be skinny and have fake boobs.


I had to get real and told him he had way too high standards for his own qualifications and that’s why he never had sex or a gf in 3 years. I said that him making 50k a year in the Bay Area, driving a Mazda 3, being a shy Asian guy, and not being that good-looking would make it nearly impossible to get any women he is willing to date or have sex with. He said “thanks a lot bro”, I think sarcastically. 


My fiancée was upstairs and heard our conversation. She came down and said that was unnecessarily harsh. She told my bro she believed in him but should really lower his standards a bit and join some online dating sites or apps.

I walked out and said if he’s going to be this idiotic, I’m not going to entertain the conversation anymore.

Well, at the beginning of the week a colleague wrote that she wanted 15-31 of August for traveling with some friends. And later that same date I asked for the same dates, since it is the only time of the year that my partner has vacations because he works a normal 9 to 17, Monday to Friday job, instead of those crazy shifts that we do as receptionists.

Next shift this colleague and I share... she comes to me and tells me she is super mad and that I am very rude and not a nice co-worker because she wrote those days first, meaning they were hers and that she already talked to her friends and booked everything (with flexible rates). I told her that by now we already should know that petitions are just petitions and that we should not book anything without having the dates approved. 
Before I wrote those dates, I talked with my partner about it and he knew I was going to request the dates, but that we should wait until at least January 15th to buy anything, if I understand this policy, why cannot she?

She drafted a lease and it’s just your general keeping things nice, no damage or else you pay for it, and any guest stays longer than a week then she will need written approval or something of equivalence. 

So at the start everything seemed to go relatively well. She did a good job at inviting me to outings with her and her friends. But slowly (about 2 weeks into me being there) she started to have her new bf around more. Come to find out her new bf is her ex fiancées groomsmen. Her and her new bf got together shortly after she broke it off with her ex. They all share a friend group so she asked me to be discreet and downplay the relationship around friends so they wouldn’t suspect anything. 

After 2-3 months of living there and having him secretly being there too every so often, it moved to them being public about the relationship. Which led to him being over every day and spending every night here. It’s worth mentioning that the house is a split level so I have the basement, she has the upstairs which opens to the kitchen which we share. The laundry room is also downstairs which has been awkward as he’s come down to do laundry at night when I’m relaxing and has gone as far to ask me to move it from washer to dryer and double check it’s dry when done. 

So out of not wanting to stir the pot ive let new bf stay at our place every night and take our travel mugs and leave multiple pairs of shoes out in the kitchen because I thought she might be rebounding. 

As you might’ve guessed they’re still spending as much as time possible together 7 months later and he’s all but moved his couch over here. After some thought I decided to bring it up to her and let her know that I felt like I was being taken advantage of in the situation because I’m paying to live here and he’s essentially moved in here and utilizing shared space but I get no benefit from it. 

Her response was that it’s her house so she’s entitled to do what she would like to with her space. She did say that she could go to his apartment (literally 2 minutes down the road) during the day on the weekend but that he will continue to stay here every night because she has dogs. 

I’m going back and forth about if I have a leg to stand on here; asking that he either not be here every night or she lower my rent to account for an additional tenant. 

TLDR: the girl I rent from owns the house and her bf has 90% moved in and stays every night with us. I asked if she would be okay with him not spending more than half the week here or lowering my rent. Her response was that it’s her house to do with what she’d like and that lowering my rent isn’t an option","False","Asshole","9","48"

"ek52yu","1578183682","AITA... husband did cocaine at bachelor party","My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1.5. First 2.5 years of dating he was in the military (U.S.) and we were long distance. We were good friends prior to being in a relationship, so the first 2 months in, it was already pretty serious (I love you’s and what not) since we knew each other so well. 

About 8 months in to our dating relationship I found out he had a profile on a dating site and was actively using it. He told me it was his married friend’s that done it as a joke (obvious lie) but later admitted to it being a ‘validation’ kind of thing. Ok. I almost broke up with him and it took a LONG time for him to gain my trust back. For the record, I don’t believe he ever physically cheated but I do know there were entire convos exchanged between him and other women ( although I don’t know what the nature of these convos were).

It’s been many years and I honestly believe I fully trust him. We got married towardS the end of 2018. He had a bachelor party in Vegas. I was completely ok with strippers (felt like it was kind of a right of passage), but asked it anything else went down (besides the ‘standard’ strippers, drinking, gambling, smoking weed). He said absolutely not.  

He just told me (Like 30 mins ago) that he actually did cocaine that weekend. I got super upset... not because of the drug (I don’t do it but am friends with plenty of people that have just tried it). Really I got upset because he has a history of lying. I honestly think that if that was the only thing he lied about I would be annoyed but not care as much, or if he told me right away when I asked. But there was already so much distrust and hurt early on in the relationship, I feel like there’s no excuse To hide anything now. At the time I would have told him I fully disapprove but wouldn’t hold a grudge if he just had told me.

I can’t tell if AITA and beating a dead horse (it’s been YEARS since the first incident), or if I’m justified in feeling hurt? Reddit, I need help!!","1578184805.0","Not the A-hole","23","18"
"ek5430","1578183829","AITA for not wanting to eat my mother's cooking anymore","so firstly, I'm F16 so I sadly can't just leave my house.

&#x200B;

So putting it plainly my mom isn't a good cook and she's the only person in the world who disagrees with that. her signature dish is spaghetti where she'll make a lot, mix it with pasta then freeze it, it tastes like nothing, like literally just water on pasta and when you're having that 4 times a week, it's not good. the other three days of the week I either get the response of 'make a crisp sandwich' or 'order take out'. she always talks about making us all eat healthier which I would be perfectly fine with if that didn't mean just making more spaghetti and freezing it. I also want to quickly say (cuz she says I'm ungrateful) that I'm very grateful that my mother actually feeds something as that's a lot better than nothing.

&#x200B;

I work for my mom at her business(retail) which I'm happy with, it's good to have a bit of money on the side so I can't complain. I do something like food studies in school and we cook in some of those classes so I know how to safely cook. these points are important later.

&#x200B;

So, that's the Lil backstory of my problem and here's where our actual argument starts. Tonight no one cooked dinner so I was told to just make something myself, to which I did, but I'm just so sick of this constant gamble of 'is it spaghetti? is it a sandwich? is it take out?' so I asked my mom if I could start cooking proper dinners for myself, cleaning up after myself and even buying the ingredients with my own money. I believe this would be good for me because I get to be more independent and learn how to cook for myself rather than in food studies where our teacher picks stuff like cookies and cakes (no complaint but I'm really bad at baking). I told her I didn't like her cooking many times so she knows that. she told me that she had to eat food she didn't like for 25 years and that's life then she told me the food she cooks in this house are the only healthy meals I eat, the 4 times a week she actually cooks. now I'm not an expert but I did food studies for 5 years so I know enough to know that that still isn't that healthy. she told me she'd never buy me take out again, once again I'd be ok with if that didn't mean I now get 3 dinners of 'make a sandwich'. I told her, I'll admit this is a bit shitty of me, that I'm just going to stop eating her cooking if it's still going to taste like literal water. she called me a 'cheeky, ungrateful, spoiled brat' then told me to get lost when I tried again to explain I wanna be independent (I would like to quickly remind you guys that this whole thing started because I offered to buy, cook and clean up after myself for dinner) so because I am such a brat and terrible child she is sending me off to go live with my grandmother for a while because she 'actually can't even deal with my disrespect'.

I kind of created this monster and have conflicting feelings on next steps. WIBTA if I tell  this guy that I’ll pay for services after the fact and that he needs to limit hitting me up to once a week during daylight hours? (Shortened for char limit)

I live in kind of a border neighborhood where there are a lot of low income rentals and a significant homeless population. Non violent crime is quite prevalent. I have PTSD  (this is relevant). I have had several situations recently where someone is going through my garbage (up by my house) or trying to break into my car (in my drive). I actually had my purse stolen out of my car in my drive while unloading groceries this summer. So any bit of activity up around the house that gets the dogs going has me on edge. 

I have a neighbor who makes a “living” returning cans and doing odd jobs. Ex con, disabled, older. He’s a nice enough guy and when he has hit me up for $$ and offered to do some work (lawn mowing , snow shoveling, poop scooping, etc) I’ve given it to him. His follow through is a little....poor. I also save up all my returnables for him.

Anyway...lately, he’s been coming to my door all hours asking for money or cans. I work from home so when he comes in the morning, I’m usually on calls and it’s disruptive to my work. To avoid that (I think) he has started knocking on my door as late as 10PM or 11PM and I’m often in bed by then since I start work at 4am. 

It drives my dog (and foster dogs) nuts and scares the shit out of me especially if I was asleep to the point that sometimes I really have to focus to avoid having a serious anxiety attack (the PTSD crap).  He himself does not frighten me in any way. I just don’t like unexpected visitors. Ever. 

He doesn’t have a phone so I understand that our communication has to be face to face. But this guy is stressing me out. If I don’t answer the door, he will knock for 10 min if he sees my car and knows I’m home. So I have to answer just to get the dogs settled. I feel like I’m basically being stalked for cash all the time. He has stopped by 3 times this week. Once saying he needed 10 bucks or his brother wouldn’t let him in the house. Then for $20 to shovel my drive (I have a service that comes) Then today he asked if I had any cans. 


I don’t want to be an AH. But I kind of do want to tell him to limit these visits and keep them to more reasonable hours. And I don’t want to give him money in advance anymore because he just isn’t reliable. 

So WIBTA to just...tell him he can stop by on Sunday afternoons else steer clear unless it’s an emergency? I know he has nothing and I can afford to lose a few bucks a week to keep a neighbor going a bit. But it’s making me uncomfortable. I just don’t want to make him uncomfortable either thinking I’m afraid of him —I’m not. At all. But PTSD doesn’t exactly work that way for me.","False","Not the A-hole","12","15"

Even when I've broken down crying or even gone to the fucking hospital because of how overbearing he is he still hasn't changed his behaviour. And it doesn't help that I'm on the autism spectrum and don't know how to be a parent or older brother, and when I try to stop or mitigate conflicts my parents get on either the both of us (and I have to explain I'm trying to stop it but they don't care), or get on me because ""I'm the older one"" and ""I should know better"", they don't get on him as often as they get on me. At this point I am desperately looking for a job so that I can get some money to my name and get out and ghost both my parents and my brother because instead of trying to help and listen to me they treat me like trash and then act surprised when I've had enough. I never want contact with any of them ever again.

I used to share my food with him but now I don't, citing that he needs to treat me better and stop quarreling with me before I share my stuff with him. Whenever I do this, my mom, dad, and sister get upset at me and say stuff like ""brothers share."" Hell nah if he treats me like a piece of dogshit then I won't reward him. That's what my parents did to me, but I'm not allowed to do it with my brother? Fucks sake.

I was at an art museum and on our way out I was in the gift shop and saw these small chocolate bars that were about the size of a credit card and a portion of the cost goes to helping families in need. I bought one, with my own money (This will be important).

Immediately my family wanted pieces of my bar, and when I got ticked off they were like ""I bought stuff for you all the time, this is how you can contribute"". Then my little brother wanted a piece but I shoved the rest of the thing in my mouth for the reasons stated above. My family immediately got pissed at me and I said I bought it with my money but they weren't listening.

Dad decided to be antagonistic and said ""I'm gonna buy dinner for all of you but he can pay for it himself."" I asked him why he was punishing me for buying stuff with my own money and parceling my stuff how I want but he didn't want to hear it and told me to stop talking.

Mom and dad had 3 dogs.  2 passed away.  She wanted to get a 2nd dog but she wanted a doberman.

He's an alcoholic, though, and was constantly hungover and refusing to go to work, so the job didn't last long. He said that they were doing a fundraiser to buy the students new stationery, and that he needed change to get it with. He knew I had a huge jar of change in my room that I had been saving up over the years to contribute to my class ring and cap and gown expenses.

He said he would pay me back in cash, if I would just count out the change and give it to him. My boyfriend came over for an in-game date night, and we spent a little of our spare time counting out my change. When we were almost done, my uncle started bringing in piles of his own change for us to count, and then standing there and talking to us the entire time, causing us to lose count multiple times. This went on for hours, and the time I could've spent with my boyfriend was spent handling my uncle's change. We were both uncomfortable, bored, and obviously couldn't talk about anything or we would lose count.

It’s been a hectic and stressful few months so heading back to my parents UK home for Christmas I was hoping to have a break before heading back to the US. 

My parents are moving house on the 7th January so Christmas time has been dominated by packing for my family (parents, one sister and one brother) this Christmas. My parents are moving out of our family home which I grew up in and moved out of 7 years ago. I was given a list of jobs to do while home as part of the move which included clearing out my old room and helping empty the loft and garden. I completed all of these jobs while home with 5 days of solid packing and this was alongside trying to run my own business but I still had the feeling of guilt when doing things other than packing up the house. This led me to struggling to get my business work done with the chaos going on. My guilt was furthered with the feeling that my sister was treating my poorly because she didn’t think I was doing enough. Purposely cooking lunch for the whole family except me (eventhough there was enough food) was a low blow from her... 

New Year’s Eve rolled around and I went to Spain for a week to celebrate the new year, try to relax, get work done and catchup with friends. The evening before I left, my sister came in my room and told me her opinion, her main points were that I was being unhelpful, selfish and putting work before family. She finished saying that I should come back earlier from Spain. This conversation kept me up the night and has been playing on my mind while I’ve been in Spain. I’m heading back to my parents house tomorrow (Sunday) to help with the final part of the move as the move date when the moving company comes is Monday & Tuesday. I’ll be accompanying them to the new house before heading back to the US. When I left my parents thanked me for my help but realistically I don’t think they would tell me if they felt the same way as my sister.

When I left there was 4/12 rooms left to pack and the most time consuming packing rooms were already done such as the loft and 3 of the 4 bedrooms. My sister changed her flights so she was staying a week longer to help out and I think she felt I should do the same. I also feel that by running my own business it’s assumed I can do what I want and put it to the side to help out.

So after my AITA post it was clear that you guys all thought I was TA, the situation bought up quite a bit that I didn't think about.

I had sent a cheque for a huge amount of money to my ex who I had badly mistreated financially due to an addiction that I'm now in recovery for. She sent me a message telling me she wasn't interested in my money and rightfully so.

Last Monday (16th dec)  I checked my online banking and saw that the cheque had been cashed and I thought to myself I'm happy she has the money and that was that I wouldn't attempt any further contact. 

On Saturday just gone, I got a message on Facebook from her, complete uturn from her original message. She explained how when we were together there was often broken promises about money and how money was coming soon and she thought immediately upon receiving the cheque that it would bounce when she paid it into the bank and was very shocked when it actually cleared and she still waited another week before she believed it was real. 

We've ended up lots of talking about our relationship and how it ended and the broken promises and mistakes upon my part. But also reminisced on some of the good times we had together. We're never going to be close friends but she seems to have accepted my apology for my actions way back when.

She told me about her current financial situation and how much the money i repaid her will improve her current quality of life.

Although realising that I was TA didn't cause me to do any different actions. I just wanted to update the situation. Although I'm still TA for how I treated her during my relationship with her. I'd like to think I'm not TA for my actions in my previous post now.

"ek5qiu","1578186881","WIBTA If I told my boss to disable a camera?","I am a temporary intern at a place in the US and at this position housing is provided. It's an apartment style place with shared bedrooms and one large living room / kitchen area that all the interns share. There is also a camera in the corner of the living room. This camera can move and turn and it's controlled by my boss. Apparently some past interns got into some trouble and this camera was installed. For a while it was facing away from the living room and didn't move so I gave it no thought, assuming that since none of us had done anything to warrant supervision, I figured the camera was disabled. A few days ago however, the camera started moving around and now a small light is blinking which I assume means it's active. When I was sitting in the living room today I heard talking and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Then I turned and saw the camera was on so I gave it an awkward wave and then I heard some laughing, so I guess there's a speaker attached too?? This makes me very uncomfortable. There aren't any cameras in our rooms but I feel weird that I could be minding my business on a day off and someone could be spying on me! I'm not sure if they can hear us talk either - what if I had a bad day and want to vent and my boss hears me? However I'm only here for 4 months and I don't own this place or pay any rent. I have privacy in my room too. Obviously if we are doing something against the rules or illegal I can understand why they would want to know about it. But we haven't done anything (or at least I haven't, I can't speak for everyone here) that isn't allowed so I don't think we should be spied on!

So.

"ek5qjs","1578186885","WIBTA If I made the mother of my grandchildren take home their gifts","Currently posting this on the behalf of my mother (f50) since we're in a argument whether it is right to have the mother (f36)  take the children's gifts back to their house.

A few days ago my mother bought 4 of the grandchildren small wooden airplanes to play with while they were visiting their house.  The gift were for no reason in particular than just for the kids to play with.  As they were heading home, the children asked to take the wood planes home with them, the grandmother said yes, the mother said no.  The mother wanted to leave the planes at grandmas house.

&#x200B;

The issue mainly is that the grandmother feels slighted and that it is disrespectful to leave the gifts at the house and that the mother should have taken the gifts home for the kids.  I have argued that it's, in the same sense, disrespectful to force the mother to take home these gifts after she has explicitly stated that they have too many toys at the house and they don't want more.

&#x200B;

The main question is, WIBTA if I made the mother take those gifts home or is she TA for not taking the gifts?

Edit: seems like the comments are pretty split but I think we see now how gray area this is, no ones really the asshole and they both have their reasons, which just need to be more accepting of people choices.  Thanks for all that commented.","1578286149.0","Asshole","6","49"

There have been a few times when I had concerns about us and wanted to talk them through.  I have mostly done it face to face in the past.

The last time I did though, things went horribly wrong.  He was showing me some pics in his phone and I happened to see something that looked suspicious.  When I confronted him about it, he got really mad and turned into a different person.  He started saying things just to hurt me.  He called me names and said that im weird.  I got upset and left his apartment.  He has reacted in a similar way other times I wanted to talk about things.  It's gotten to the point where I hesitate to express myself at all because I don't want to be treated that way.

Lately I've been feeling like he's not very happy to be with me.  I'll say things like ""Im so in love with you"" and ""You make me so happy"" and he responds with a half-hearted ""I love you too.""  He just seems bummed out to be with me.

So I texted him today, voicing some of these concerns.  I wasnt rude or accusatory - I was coming from a place of hurt, not anger.  I just told him how I feel, hoping for some reassurance that I do make him happy.  He immediately got angry and started saying hurtful things.  He said that I never tell him how I feel in person, only through text (which is not the case).  He said that he's mad and now doesn't want to see me tonight, and that texting him how I feel is a huge turn off.  He said I was being immature and im afraid to tell him face to face how I feel.  Among other things.

I've told him before that because of how he reacts, it makes me hesitant to bring up anything at all.  So tell me, who is the asshole here?","False","Not the A-hole","5","24"

Now it was fine when he was a baby because he pretty much slept all the time but now that he's older I really can't handle him. I ask her all the time to find back up babysitting but she gives me some sort of excuse.

I just can't handle his high energy it gives me panic attacks. I've told her countless times I don't want anything to do with her or my nephew for maybe just a short period of time but then she shows up the next day for HOURS.

"ek61gp","1578188358","AITA for speaking Polish in front of my mum's Italian fiancé?","So... we're all living in the UK, my mum and I are from Poland, the fiancé comes from Italy. They've met here in the UK a little while ago. After a year or so of them being together, she decided to move in with him. Since I'm still quite young, I had no other choice but to follow. Living with a man I barely knew was something I was a bit reluctant with, which my mum seemed to know and understand. The first few months of such were quite smooth, we've mostly managed to live at peace with one another, and there was no conflict whatsoever. We've barely talked over that time period and the only forms of spending time were the occasional dinner together, but it was not something I minded too much. Speaking English is in general something I always quite alright with, and switching to the language was something I was at first willing to adapt to for my mum's sake.

This attitude of mine has however recently changed. During this year's holiday period (the first one the three of us spent together), we ended up visiting the fiancé's family a couple of times, eating dinners together and going out to the cinema for a movie. Let me just mention there that all his family members in question have lived in the UK for years and know how to speak perfect English, so a language barrier on their end was of no issue. During these happenings, the fiancé was REPEATEDLY switching over between English and Italian while addressing the family, making it difficult for mum and I to contribute, at times. While my mum can speak the language a little, I did not understand a word and was left in the awkward situation where I could not really do too much since participating in the conversations was impossible and me sitting on the phone during a family dinner would be inappropriate. I have not even received an apology or anything from him, so I figured that speaking English in front of one another is unnecessary and that I'm worrying too much about the languages.

Ever since the holidays have ended, I've started to address my mum in Polish whenever I want something from her or need her help with anything. Apparently I was wrong, though. What I witnessed after 1-2 times was mum immediately switching over back to English and telling me to do so as well, saying that I cannot treat her fiancé like this and that it's unfair towards him. Pissed off by the double standards, I've stormed off to my room and decided to screw that, deciding to no longer talk to her for the rest of the day.

"ek61ik","1578188366","AITA for not cutting my hair in support of my grandmother?","My grandmother was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, but has a 70% chance of surviving with the treatments the doctors are going to be administering. She won't lose all of her hair with this, but is going to cut it short anyway and just wear wigs everywhere because she's always wanted to wear wigs and this is as good a time as any to do so.

My mother and aunt are getting the same haircut as her to support her in her fight against the cancer. My mom told me I *need* to cut my hair like them to support my grandmother. I told my mother that I want to support her in other ways, like doing my grandmother's chores and taking her to doctor's appointments. My mom got pissy and said that isn't enough support, then shoved her phone in my face and waved it around, showing me the haircut she's getting. 

I think supporting my grandmother at home and at the doctor's is far more important than getting matching haircuts. I help my grandmother out with household chores more than anyone since my parents work more than me and my sister can't bend due to rods in her back. I also take care of our animals daily. We have 4 ducks, 3 chickens, and two cats. The birds have to be tended to twice a day and can be a pain in the ass at times. Despite all of this, my mother acts like I do nothing around the house and just play video games all day. Sure, I do play a lot of video games, but I also make sure things are taken care of first. I have my priorities straight. 

I also don't want to look exactly like my mother because no one would be able to tell us apart. She and I have the same height, same build, same hair color, pretty much the same face, and matching glasses. I want to be my own person, and not just a carbon copy of my mother. We work at the same company as well, so our coworkers would probably confuse us for one another a lot more than they already do.

I recently visited and stayed at their house for ten days (we're long distance so this is normal). While I was there I had a bath (\~1 hour) at least once a day, usually twice.

Some of the housemates said that it was inconsiderate of me to occupy the bathroom for so long. While I was bathing they would knock on the door after about 30 minutes and ask me to hurry up, saying that they needed to shower or brush their teeth. I understand their POV but I tried not to have baths during peak bathroom hours and it's my view that they shouldn't bank on being able to always access the bathroom in a shared house.

I made plans with someone to meet up today and hang out and had these plans for three days. Everyone knew I had these plans as I had spoken about them frequently. 

Anyways, as I’m getting ready to leave to meet up with my friend, my sister walks up to me and says “I think we’re going to visit aunt and uncle today”. We’ve been here for two weeks and haven’t had a chance to see my aunt and uncle yet this trip as my aunt has the flu. 

I of course get annoyed as this isn’t the first time my sister has sprung plans on me when I’ve already solidified my own. I tell her that I already have plans and I’m not going to break my word as I’ve already given it and it’s rude to do so. I leave and go hang out with my friend and I text my sister that I’ll head over when they do and just text me the address and time. The movie we were watching ran a little later than expected and I wouldn’t have been able to make it in time before everyone else left. 

I texted my aunt and let her know that I love her and I wouldn’t be able to make it before everyone left and if it was okay for me to come later. My aunt lets me know it’s okay and to just come when I can. I intended to head over as soon as the movie finished but right after my aunt texted me my other sister send me a message that said my uncle said just come tomorrow. I asked my aunt if that was preferred and she told me whatever works best for me. I went ahead and said I would just see them tomorrow. Didn’t get a text back. 

A few hours later I walk through the door to my dads house and suddenly I’m being bombarded my both my sisters my brother and my older sisters annoying boyfriend who wasn’t even there saying that my uncle is pissed at me and I’m an asshole. They even went as far as making plans for dinner in front of me and then not inviting me. 

My aunt seemed okay with the plan but everyone else is hanging up on me for keeping my word. I love my aunt and uncle dearly and I do want to see them but I’m at an age rn where figuring out my priorities is becoming a struggle especially when I’ve made plans and another involving family is sprung on me. I’ve always had to arrange my schedule and cancel plans to cater to others so since becoming a legal adult I’ve tried to prioritize myself and keeping my word.  So AITIA?

New year, my mother ordered new furniture as usual. Apparently when they were putting together all the stuff, they forgot to finish the bed frame for one of my youngest brothers, and told her over the phone ""it should be simple to finish"".  Of course I got the call to come finish the bed frame. I tell her just make them come back over as they have to complete the work they were hired for, ""well they did most of it and I just don't want to deal with back and forth on the phone"". Tell her that I really don't feel like it and haven't put together furniture since I was a teen. Doesn't seem to care, so I go over.

Get there, of course my siblings, youngest brother and two sisters are all playing in the room. Tell them to go play in the living room until I finish, ask my mother to watch them and make sure they don't interrupt.

Take all the things out, midway, first knock. Sister forgot her phone charger, give it to her. Reading the instructions and put together  the designed head and foot of the frame. Second knock, youngest sister wanted some of her toys, ask her to look quickly. Tell my mother again, to PLEASE watch them, because I'm at my worst when I'm not focused. Start putting together most of the frame and screwing it in, when my little brother runs into the room to to grab his ipad without even knocking, threaten him and he leaves. Start finishing the bottom of the frame, and realize I fucked up, since the at the two side frame, it's upside down. So begin to unscrew it, on the second screw, lo and behold brother runs in AGAIN to get his ipad charger without knocking, I was somehow surprised and in the middle of unscrewing pulled my hand back and heard a metal sound. great....

Check the screw, it's one of those hexagonal ones and apparently I had caused some damage because now it wont' turn no matter what I do. Yup it's stripped. Ask my mother if she had pliers, nope. Told her I need pliers to remove the screw and have to go to home depot a little less than an hour away. She gets agitated asking how I could mess up a simple frame. Told her she needed to stop being so laissez faire and let my siblings run in and out of the room, I messed up the screw because of it. Told me she wanted it done soon, and to ""fucking do something"". I said ok, she walked in the kitchen, I walked out the door and went home.

4 hours later, I guess she didn't notice, she calls me crying saying how disrespectful I was and that If I didn't really want to come over, I should just not have.

They have basically been telling him he can “do better” our entire relationship. 

I graduated after my boyfriend and moved in with him (who was an engineer already living on his own). I had a spell of “unemployment”. Although, I was generating $$$ online- sometimes even more than my bf. I also used this time to deal with something personal. Of course, this whole time his family used my employment as something else to shit on me for. 

Well I eventually got a job- a great one. I told my boyfriend not to tell his family that I got an actual job unless they specifically ask him. I also told him not give details about my title or my salary (because I know they’re dying to know). “She works with electronics. She doesn’t want me to disclose her personal details” is basically what I told him to tell them. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m a major asshole for this, but I’m just done with his family at the moment. I spent so many years trying to please them, only to have them make me shed lots of tears. I know I can easily tell them what I do/how much I make, but it’s oddly satisfying having them think I mooch off my boyfriend, but then see what I’m doing on social media and thinking “wait how would they afford that?” (Yes my bf is an engineer, but this is in California lol. He can barely afford to live by himself.) 

BUT I also can see my boyfriend’s side of things. 
Would like to hear other opinions! Am I an asshole for this?

We lived in coharmony; respecting each other, taking chores, not really getting in each other's way, all until about 5 or 6 months back when J (20m) moved in.

The house has three separate bedrooms and two common areas, so J was to sleep on the couch in the common area we didn't use. He proceeded to take over the common area that was being used instead so he could play games and sleep with a television on in front of him. He then proceeds to ask for food because he has no money because he spends it all on juuls, cigarettes, and video games, then throws food that he leaves out because ""it's gone bad.""

This has been going on for a few months and we (being C, K, and myself) all said something about his habits at some point or another but eventually things started to grind us down: leaving food out for days without touching it, cooking things and eating out of the pan then sitting the pan out for days, trash around the house, refusing to clean up after a pet he tried to take care of, and leaving a thing of chocolate milk for so long it got so thick it couldn't go down the drain.

Over the course of the months I have progressively gotten more and more aggressive with my slights towards him such as making fun of him and calling him out on things. I haven't crossed any lines such as full out cussing him out in front of people or bringing up his own personal history, things I know would be crossing that line. I have yelled at him and ripped into him from time to time, but nothing physical. 

This all came to a head last night when I found out that he had been using my shampoo without telling me when he had his own bottle. I got on to him again and he complained to C about how I'm always on his case and he wants to pick a fight with me (he's about 120 lbs and thin as a twig, I'm 260, built like a linebacker who played in high school but never went to college).

Basically I started dating my boyfriend last year, and this year my parents asked to meet him. I told them that’s no problem, but he would only be able to be in town to meet them for 2 days and would not stay for Christmas. Originally they were okay with this and I thought all was well. 

However, a week before we were set to leave my parents called me and asked if we could come later instead, so we could be there for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I explained to them I’d be staying after my boyfriend left, but they told me my dad would be working the 2 days my boyfriend would be there and wouldn’t really be able to meet him. I felt bad, but there was nothing we could do, my boyfriend only has certain days off work and wanted to be home for Christmas eve and Christmas day to be with his kids (obviously). 

They tried to compromise by asking us to try and exchange our plane tickets and they’d pay the difference, but we don’t have plane tickets because we are driving. My parents offered to pay for plane tickets, but my boyfriend cannot fly because he has PTSD from a helicopter crash he was in when he was in the Navy. I really tried to explain my side of the story, but my parents got really angry and accused me of not wanting to spend time with them and choosing my boyfriend over them. 

They called my boyfriend a ton of names and called into question the nature of our relationship and I felt very disrespected. I ended up telling my parents I wasn’t going to be coming home because of how they were acting and that I didn’t want to make a cross country drive by myself (there were no more plane tickets reasonably priced by the time this happened).

I had a great Christmas with my boyfriend and his kids, but since then my parents have been very irate with me and my sister called me to tell me I was being a brat.

Basically my sister and her husband have 3 kids together with a 4th on the way. We all live up in Canada and I live about 3 hours from my parents and my sister's family.  
My parents go down to Florida every winter and usually fly back home for Christmas and spend it at my sister's place. I usually come down for a few days usually working around my work schedule. I work shift work, so sometimes its hard to get time off around Xmas, as well as I don't have a ton of seniority. But I can usually muster up a few days here and there to make the 3 hour drive to see the fam for Xmas.

So my parents decided to fly my sister, her husband and 3 kids down to Florida for Xmas this year. Obviously I was offered a ticket as well, however, due to work I couldn't get any time off. I thought this was great and just a one time thing. I mean my sister's kids are very small and they won't be able to do disney for awhile.

But now, my sister is telling me my parents are going to fly them down every year now and have Christmas down South from now on. Now as I described above, Its extremely hard for me to get a lot of time off to go down to Florida around Xmas time. Which basically means I'll never get to see my family around Xmas. As well as usually flight tickets are about $500 a person round trip. Thats roughly $2500 to $3000 (when they get next kid) in flight tickets a year to fly them there and back. I'm a single guy here, and feel like I really would be losing my family here over Xmas, not to mention financial equality between myself and my sister.

"ek6li5","1578191089","AITA for being upset that my partner didn't like my quiche?","Prefacing this by saying I already know this is silly, but I need to see if I'm really being unreasonable here. Also, *not* a throwaway and I know that my partner frequents this sub so here's hoping I get some support on my side for him to witness lol

So basically after a long while of eating mainly convenience foods and feeling uninspired, I've finally gotten into cooking again. I got a big boost in confidence after cooking a few simple dishes and decided to try my hand at making a quiche for the first time. I'm not an ""expert"" by any means, but I make edible food that actually tastes pretty good!

My partner is a very picky eater. He's not adverse to trying new things and doesn't turn his nose up at too much, though he admittedly avoids certain foods without having tried them due to certain qualities (mostly textural). He had expressed excitement when I told him about the quiche, but after it finished he said it was ""too runny for him"" and wouldn't eat it. 

I was immediately upset and started crying over it, which caused a small argument. We talked it over and it didn't escalate into anything more, though he suggested he would try the quiche later once it had had some time to set a little more in the fridge. 

He went to work, and I ended up going to bed for the night. When he got home later that night, in a brief moment of consciousness (and as he was set up with a bowl of Lucky Charms) I asked if had tried my quiche. He just gave me a look. He hadn't tried it! I was annoyed, but I let it go and went back to sleep, even though I was pretty upset.

There have been times my partner has cooked for me, food that wasn't necessarily my favorite or prepared to my tastes, but I still ate them because he went through the effort and I was grateful for the gesture. I never complained, and never critiqued his cooking. However, this wasn't the first time he's refused food made by me, and he likes to give me ""pointers"" on my cooking that I find obnoxious and offensive. It hurt my feelings quite a bit that I spent the money, time and effort to make a meal that he wasn't even willing to try. It won't stop me from cooking in the future but it's a definite slight to my ego. Even if it is kind of silly.

Still live with my parents (18F)My parents have a “New Years resolution” about losing weight, for like the 5th year in a row.  So far I am the only one losing weight out of the three of us. 

I don’t have a problem with their resolution. But because of that, they don’t want to go out anywhere or anything. I haven’t been with my parents to the movies for 8 years and I really wanted to go but my mom says that “it’s torture for her,” and my dad says “I need to lose weight including you.”

I told my dad that we don’t even have to get any food or drink and he still says no. They said we can have dinner tomorrow but they’re choosing a “healthy” place, which is a place I dislike and have told them before That I don’t like. I asked about sweets to which my dad tells me I’m fat and I don’t need it. A small piece of cake (we don’t get huge cakes, just the tiny slices) isn’t going to do anything. 

I already know I don’t get gifts for my birthday since it’s close to Christmas. I don’t care about material stuff or food or whatever. I’m just upset that my parents seem to just not want to hang out with me or do anything. I’m more upset about the movie stuff. My dad likes movies but doesn’t even want to go with me, even though my parents have been to the movies together (either didn’t tell me until after or told me right before they left) and I just feel kinda left out. I thought my birthday was going to finally be a day we can have fun and do things together but no because for my mom it’s “torture” and I need to “lose weight”.

I’d just rather stay in my room and play video games and talk with my friends and study for my college classes that are soon to come back up.

My sister (23) and I (27) moved into separate houses a few months ago. I was already out on my own and was moving into a rental house with my boyfriend. My sister just bought her first house, and it's the first time she's lived away from home. I'm super proud of her for that, but now my mom is pressuring me to buy a house instead of renting. It's not something I want at this stage in my life, but she would bring it up every time I saw her.

She would also be very critical of my weight. I've lost more than 30 pounds this past year through cleaning up my diet and starting a running regimen, but she doesn't praise me for it the way she praises my sister and her house.

It just feels like my mom wants me to be my sister. I know she does it because she cares about me, but it feels like she's being too critical and I don't know how to tell her about it without hurting her feelings.

It's probably been about a month since I went to visit my mom. I don't live far away, but she wants me to see her on my weekends, which are also her weekends. However, those are also the only days I get to spend time with my boyfriend because we have opposite work schedules.

"ek6o3h","1578191467","AITA For being mean to my grandfather","My grandfather has made me uncomfortable on several occasions over the past years with his comments about me (20F) and my appearance. A few moments I can think of specifically are the times he would smack my butt as I walked by him, him calling me sexy in an outfit (I was in my mid teens), and a year ago when I dyed my hair pink he said he wasn't a fan and my hair ""Didn't turn him on"".

Now over the years, I started to get fed up with how tense and uncomfortable I would get in his presence and how it wasn't fair, so I started being extremely cold and distant as a way to fight back. If he talks to me, I barely respond. I don't look at him, I don't go near him, and I don't answer any calls or texts from him.

My family is the standard southern type where if we have the same blood, you should always be treated as family. So you can imagine the way my family feels about the constant rude attitude I have whenever my grandfather is present. Since it was a lot of holidays recently, it meant I was around him a lot more than I would like and my father made the comment (not the first time) that I make it very clear to everyone how much I hate him and it hurts everyone, especially my grandfather. Also, my brother basically called me a female dog for the way I treated my grandfather, and said I should be ashamed of myself.

With everyone in my family telling me that I could be nicer, it makes me wonder if I am going about this situation wrong? He is getting older, and at times I feel bad.

So obviously this was a few days ago but I forgot about the existence of this sub and decided I wanted strangers opinions. 

Anywho, so basically it was approaching midnight and I was at my Local Towns street party with my friends and my girlfriend. Since I had been drinking I was needing to go to the toilet regularly and at about 11:50 I couldn’t hold out any long so I ran for the public toilets. On the way there and the way back I kept catching people I hadn’t seen in awhile so i would very quickly greet them and ask how they are etc. And then made my way to the bathroom. Being half cut I didn’t fully realise the time and it was nearly the new year so I pelted it back through the crowds trying to find the group I was with and when I got back my gf was visibly upset because she thought I was going to miss the bells. So New Years happened and we kissed yadda yadda and then I say to her that I’m going to go quickly and find people that weren’t with the group to wish them a happy New Years and such before we left to go back to her house and since it was cold i wanted to get it done as fast as possible. So I went off and when I returned she was extremely upset at me for leaving even though I explained why I left 

Now she also gets pretty iffy around new people and I’m a pretty social guy so I have a decent friend group outside of the one I know her from and I didn’t want to have to get her to be meeting all these people she didn’t know so this is also part of the reasoning I went off on my own
Edit: I didn’t make it clear but my gf was with a group of friends we both knew well and her best friend was also there so I didn’t leave her completely on her own

"ek6s9w","1578192045","AITA for blaming my players for ruining a DnD session?","Recently I held a one-off session that acted as an origin story to the current main campaign, giving players a few more pieces to the mystery puzzle, as the players are behind in piecing together the mystery in the main campaign. I used this one-off to better help them understand that the situation is perhaps more than just surface level.

The session was an infiltration/spy mission where every day they had to complete a task, the tasks would at first seem disjointed and share no connection, but slowly the tasks would reveal the master plan, allowing the players to steal an artefact from the next-door museum.

The problems started almost immediately as there was confusion about the first task. ""Create a path from your rooms to the museum."" At first, they didn't entirely understand how to complete this task, that I wanted. The players weren't supposed to look at the piece of paper and immediately know what to do, they would have to explore the area, learn valuable information, etc.

However, no matter how much information I gave my players, they did not follow up on any of it, as they were too focused on 'the wording' of the task, ""A path?"" They asked. I gave them many solutions to the task through many high roll perception checks.

""This rope could be used as a zip line from your window to the museum.""

""You see a high fence, in level with your window, that could be used to prop up a plank of wood and allow you to cross to the museum.""

etc.

My players even after so many other solutions like these still, they still sat there scratching their chins going ""A path?"" whilst I sat there going ""Please, stop being dumb and just listen to what I'm telling you.""

They didn't, what was supposed to take 30 minutes max took up a whole three and a half hours as the players ran around in circles getting frustrated as they tried to solve what I meant by ""A path."" whilst I became frustrated from giving them their answer over and over again.

The pacing of the session was thrown completely off. I had to sadly cut out an entire players ""story"" from the session, making it so they had no impact on the story, for the sake of completing the story by the end of the session.

At the end my players confronted me about the session, they were not pleased. They said that this is the first time that a session of mine had more low points than high. And that if this type of thing were to happen again, they would find a new Dungeon Master. I promptly blew up at them and kicked them out of my house without dinner, pizza that my parents made.

After thinking about how I acted over the next few days and I've decided to come here for a neutral perspective. I know that I acted harsh towards them and it may have been too harsh. But I firmly stand by how I think that they didn't listen to what I said during the session and that was the reason why the session was thrown off the rails, and why it wasn't enjoyable for either party.

So, over the summer me and seven of my classmates went on a mission trip out west to Wyoming. It was a road trip so we made several stops along the way and on the way back. Over the course of the trip we bonded and got very close. We even exchanged some very personal information and stories in what you might call a “therapy session”.

But as soon as we got back home and back to school, everything went back to how it was. The whole “elite eight” lost its mystique and the only thing that really keeps us close is the personal info we shared. 

Well we decided to reunite for another trip out west again this summer. I didn’t have a girlfriend over the summer, but I’ve had one now since September. We’re really close, almost inseparable. Her and another girl joined the team making it ten of us.

But it seems like some people in our original group try to purposely exclude my girlfriend and this new girl from get-togethers just because they weren’t apart of the original group. And I completely understand that everything we shared was very personal and that the eight of us will always have that,  but it just doesn’t seem fair.

To be honest, I’d feel the same way even if my girlfriend weren’t going. If it were any two new people, I’d still feel awful for excluding them.

But I can’t condone hanging out with this original group and keeping my girlfriend out of the loop. It’s basically lying by not telling her about it and I know that she’d feel awful if she knew she was being left out. She already feels like she’s invading our original group and what we had, but a few of us have convinced her otherwise.

Also, it’s not that they don’t like my girlfriend. She’s the sweetest person ever and literally couldn’t hurt a fly. They just are so stuck on this “original eight” philosophy.

I told him that his rights had been terminated, which he already knew (I had emailed him about it). He argued that I should let him meet her because they still have a blood connection and because I started dating my husband soon after my ex left, it wasn’t as if my daughter was ever unsupported or didn’t have a father figure. However, I refused to let him meet her and told him I would let her decide for herself when she is capable of making that decision on her own.

My daughter is only 8 and is extremely sensitive. She certainly has issues with the fact that her father left and she never knew him. We’re looking into therapy options, but for now, I just don’t think she’s capable of handling this, so I haven’t told her and probably won’t for a while.

So, my stepmom's niece is getting married in Hawaii this May. The issue is, the dates of the trip are over my chorus and band concert, with the actual wedding being on the date of my band concert. Also, we'd be getting back the day before I have to take my SAT's. 

Now, normally, the choice should be to go to Hawaii. But I told my family I can't go, because of these reasons. Her family and I don't get along, except for a few exceptions, they are all super judgemental and rude to me. Especially the bride and her mother (my stepmom's sister.) But it's Hawaii, right? I really hate beaches and hot climates, and don't get me wrong, I'm so thankful for the opportunity but it's genuinely someplace I wouldn't be happy in at all. 

Next, the real issue. I am very depressed, and what gets me through is my music. Missing these concerts means I couldn't be in any of my small ensembles for the rest of the school year.

A couple of people have said I should have given him an ultimatum, a chance to better himself before removing him from the equation. I don’t agree with that idea, but I’m open to being corrected. 


Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s get into it. Three people live in my household. Myself (M 26), and my two roommates that we’ll call T (M 28) and P (M 36) I’ve known T for 9 years or so and lived with him for 7, while P moved in a little over a year ago. As it turns out, P is a complete and utter slob. Barely ever cleans up after himself, and spends the overwhelming majority of his free time in the living room. 


He occasionally takes week-long vacations to visit family out of state, and on three separate occasions I have opted to clean up his mess in his absence. The most recent occurrence was around Christmas time, and [here](https://imgur.com/9ExBFeU) is the before and after pictures I took of our living room. I didn’t do this out of any desire to be nice and help him out. I was just tired seeing such a mess every single day in my own home. 


I decided that I’ve had enough. T and I came to an agreement that if P can’t clean up after himself, we don’t want to live with him anymore. We also agreed to not tell him about our decision; the logic was that P would most likely “straighten up” for a couple of weeks to a month, and then revert to his usual ways. We would rather just get this whole thing over with. It’s not even just about the cleanliness anymore. He smokes in the house, despite being told repeatedly to smoke outside. It’s against the landlord’s rules to smoke inside. He also has a bad case of alcoholism. It’s really, really bad. He’s drunk more often than he’s sober. He leaves beer cans in the living room and the bathroom. I hoped that if he moved in with us, that we could help him get better. I’ve known him for about 7 years, and I’ve always considered him a friend. It’s been a year, there hasn’t been meaningful improvement in any area, and I’m sick of it. 


While P was gone, T and I cleaned the entire house, from top to bottom. I hadn’t seen it that clean in a long, long time. We felt that having such a thorough cleaning ought to be a good indicator that this is the way things ought to stay. Unfortunately, the living room has deteriorated since he’s come back, and I’ve found cigarette ashes in the garbage can he uses for beer cans 3 times, and once in the bathroom garbage can. Enough is enough. We’re telling him tomorrow that he has until the 5th of February to find other living arrangements. Are T and I assholes for not telling P he was on such thin ice?


EDIT: I should clarify; the second time I cleaned the house during his absence and he came back to a relatively clean house, T and I sat him down and laid out several ground rules that we expected him to follow. No smoking in the house, clean up after yourself, pretty basic stuff. He seemed to make an effort for a couple of weeks, but slipped back to his old ways after that.

"ek7e3h","1578195158","AITA for calling my former boss an asshole","A few years ago I (24F) was supervised at work by Sean (\~36M). Although he worked remotely, we had to be in constant contact to stay synced up on how we were approaching our projects. Over the course of about a year our daily shop talk turned to friendly banter and eventually to ... increasingly personal conversations.

Sean rubs most people at my company the wrong way; they agree he is intelligent, but he thinks very highly of himself, and often says things that come off as harsh and condescending. But he would shower me in praise for my work and often mentioned how much he enjoyed talking to me and how much he cared about me. I idolized him and the attention felt amazing.

In my defense, I was depressed and reeling from a bad breakup. But I still knew what we were doing was wrong because 1. he has a WIFE and KIDS 2. we confided in each other about deeply private stuff 3. we often continued our conversations outside of working hours.

EDIT: I should clarify he did not have romantic intentions towards me.

EDIT: I know I'm an asshole for the above! I'm asking about the *next* part!

When Sean messaged me one night wanting my input on NAMES for his wife's NEW BABY I privately decided I'd had enough and resolved to shut the whole thing down at the next opportunity. I woke up to a note explaining that his wife saw this particular conversation and she exploded (reasonable) and demanded he stop talking to me outside of work (also reasonable) and that he had to stop being my friend. I was so relieved! Then, days later, he said he got the go-ahead to resume speaking with me. I declined the offer, saying that the whole situation made me extremely uncomfortable, and apologized for causing tension in his marriage.

For weeks Sean begged me to forgive him for ""ruining our friendship,"" which freaked me out. I told him to stop contacting me (he agreed) and I transferred to a new team. Finally, the rose-colored glasses came off, and I started noticing other red flags. He liked and followed political content on social media that I found offensive, so I told him to unfollow me. I saw and heard that he was ruder to his other supervisees than I had realized, causing them serious emotional distress.

Months later, we were both part of a phone meeting and when I witnessed him acting dismissively towards my colleagues as usual, I snapped and privately sent him an angry note calling him an asshole among other things. He was so bewildered by my reaction that I admitted to him that I was not just mad about his behavior in the meeting, but furious that we were ever ""friends"" in the first place.

This altercation happened almost a year ago. Every once in a while I take a peek at his social media account. He posts thinly veiled criticisms of me ... frequently. He remains ""badly wounded"" by my outburst to this day. He thinks I ""cancelled"" him for his political beliefs. He has called me ""cruel"" and ""vicious.""

Am I insane or is this a gross misreading of what transpired? Was I the asshole?","1578198076.0","Asshole","6","10"

So yesterday, the ipad ran out of battery right when he was playing it and he asked me to go power it up.

He asked me what that was and I told him it was how the ipad was going to ""come alive"" again. He seemed to want to know more, so I explained the socket allowed electricity to flow into the chord and the ipad. He seemed to understand, so I plugged it in and went to do homework.

10 minutes later, I see him fiddling with the wall socket and I don't want him to get shocked so I tell him that the socket is dangerous and he shouldn't be playing with it. Well he seemed to want to do exactly what I told him not to do because he started playing around with it some more. I warned him a second time and made sure he knew that it was dangerous and he could get ""zapped.""

They thought that he meant in a video game, but after I told them what happened and how I ""let him"" fiddle with the wall socket, they exploded at me.

So my friend and I are going to a concert in March, we originally were going to just go there and then back home the same night (1-2 hours each way). But yesterday my friend messaged me and asked if we could book a motel for the night of the concert because she doesn't want to go home sleepy (she's gonna be driving) and that she can pay for it.

I have no problem with staying at a motel, I'm glad my friend's being proactive about our safety, I'm just concerned financially.

I've been budgeting for the concert but I'm very doubtful my budget will stretch to paying my half for the motel room.

So would it be an asshole thing to do if I just let her pay for the motel room? I don't have my full license so me driving back afterwards is a no-go, I am going to be giving her petrol money though.

So here’s my situation. I’m F13, about to turn 14 in a few months. My mom and I have never really had a stable relationship, and if I’m being frank, I don’t really trust her, nor confide in her with my feelings. But that’s a different topic. Anyways, my mom likes to just take my clothes, without asking. 

She’s relatively short, and I’m a few inches taller than her, so jeans always end up looking longer, and sweatshirts + pullovers sometimes bunch up, or they don’t fit right. I’ve expressed to her multiple times that I don’t feel comfortable with her just taking my clothes to wear whenever she feels like it, especially if it’s for certain events; like meeting family friends or just going out for the day. I would prefer if she asked me before just taking it. I’ve told her this multiple times, as well, and she only responds with “I’m your mother, I can take your clothes. And you have SO many clothes, as well.” But she ALSO has quite a few clothes in her closet, so I’m not sure why she likes to take mine.

Today was my final straw. I had just woken up, not in the best mood, and I walk out to see my mom in one of my favorite jackets, wearing some of my pants, and my socks. She’s never taken my socks before, and I don’t see why she had to. We have PLENTY of socks to go around. Maybe even too many. I recognized these as my own because they have a special pattern on them, and I received them as a small gift from one of my friends. I was pretty angry, so I told her that I’m tired of constantly telling her to not take my clothing without asking, and that if she wanted to wear something, the LEAST she could do was ask me. She then got up in my face, yelled at me a ton, and said that she’ll do whatever she wants because she’s my mother.

This happened a few hours ago, and it leads me to now. My mom hasn’t spoken to me all day, and whenever I ask her a simple question, she pretends like she doesn’t hear me. This is her go-to behavior whenever my actions don’t necessarily please her. Not sure how long this post has gotten, so I’ll do a TLDR.

TLDR; My mom consistently takes my clothes without permission. And after this happened again this morning, I snapped and told her to at least ask me for permission. She got angry at me, and she has been silent ever since.

I won't go into detail but I now have a 3 year PFA and he is on probation for 5 years. Before criminal Court was finished I began seeing R's parents so that they could see their granddaughter. I started to trust them but stayed cautious. 

At this point there is no custody agreement but the PFA gives me full custody. After criminal courts finished I started dropping my daughter off at R's parents and after I left R would see her. Slowly she was spending longer with them and doing day trips. Everything seemed to be going great given the circumstances. 

R's mom (L) texted me yesterday asking when she could see my daughter again. In the past she has had Wednesdays off. So I said that I was busy this weekend could we do Wednesday. She informed me that she no longer has Wednesdays off but she understood that I'm busy. This morning I thought about it and realized I could run some errands around their city tonight so that they could see daughter. (they live an hour away) L messaged back and said she was sick and R for the first time since the PFA texted me asking if I could meet his friend that I know at the police station and drop daughter off with him so that he could still see daughter. 

I replied back agreeing but sent a very specific text stating I needed his word that he would go to a public place with her and friend would stay with, he agreed. When I picked daughter back up I asked friend what they did and he said they went to a friend's house and just chilled. That is obviously not a public place.  There is no doubt in my mind that R had no intentions of honoring his word. He is a man that is incapable of being told what to do. I called L and explained to her why I was so upset. She argued that it shouldn't matter that they were at a friend's house. It matters to me. I already had little trust and I set up a boundary. He gave me his word and broke it, losing what little trust I had left. 

I messaged L and stated that due to the breach of trust I was no longer comfortable with dropping daughter off anywhere. From now on either me or my father must be present in a public place. She sent me back a picture with R holding daughter with I'm assuming his new gfs daughter. At this point I should have stopped replying but said there's no one to blame but her son.

So recently my boyfriend decided to get another puppy. We have three cats and a dog in the house already, but it’s a big house with a big yard, and he wanted his dog to have another dog to play with and burn energy. He looked through several dogs and found one on Craig’s list eventually that he liked. 

The dog was super cute and all, but as he talked more to the woman selling him, I started to get nervous about the whole thing. First of all, her add got flagged for removal, and when asked about it she just blamed it on “haters”. Then she refused to send any additional pictures or videos of the puppy. She also said he had his shots but she didn’t have proof becuase it wasn’t done at the vet because ds “that’s where sick dogs go.” I begged my bf not to go, but he said he “might as well check it out.” 

To my surprise, the puppy was real, and we weren’t robbed. The lady was weird and standoffish, but we gave her the money and took the dog home. At first he was just like a normal puppy, but over the course of the day he got more and more lethargic, and then began to shit and puke everywhere. My bf rushed him to the emergency vet, where we learned he had parvo. They gave him a less then 50%  chance of living if he didn’t stay in the hospital and get blood transfusions, but he couldn’t afford it. The other options were to euthanize the puppy, or take him home and try and Medicate him. 

My boyfriend is FURIOUS at me becuase I told him I thought unfortunately the best option would be to euthanize him. I didn’t want him to bring the puppy home and put the other animals at risk, only for him to die anyways and suffer longer. The poor thing could barely move, he couldn’t eat or drink, and I just don’t want any animal to suffer. 

So, AITA?

Edit/update: Well, my boyfriend brought the puppy home, and he died shortly after. I’m looking for a new place to live, because I refuse to put my cat at risk. We bleached everything, cleaned the entire house from top to bottom.

First time poster, long term asshole questioner. Been friends with this person for over 15 years, since the beginning of high school. Friend has had several bouts with what could be deemed as depressive episodes, low self esteem, anxiety, etc. Somehow our friendship has always involved her opening up to me and seeking advice for a wide range of issues, and me giving as much of my insight and support as possible, often for hours at a time. Now background is I myself suffer from mental health issues, and often feel overwhelmed, especially with changes in routine such as my current new job and being in a city with no family or friends.

Getting to my point, I have repeatedly suggested to my friend that I can't give her the correct advice or tools to deal with her current issues, which largely involve relationship and dating issues. When I try to keep the convo short, it somehow always ends up ruminating for several hours and I feel drained, when I am barely managing my own mental health.

They have said they don't need a therapist because they could talk to me, and they also open up to several other people about the same issue. I have a background in mental health but by no means equipped to deal with some of the things she has expressed she needs help with. I feel it is the right thing to do to suggest she seek out the right person to help support her. However on the other hand I am feeling like bad friend for not listening and supporting her as much as she needs.

Obviously the last couple weeks have been filled with festivities, and for comparison, last year I was completely alone for Christmas, hung out with a couple friends for New Year's eve and that was it for me. This 2019-2020 I have been to an Aunt's birthday party, a Christmas Party, a New Years party as well as being expected to spend entire days with her little brothers (with whom I like to hang out with, but it can get exhausting) and then just random get-togethers for no apparent reason. I have had enough and don't want any social interaction with her family for the next couple of weeks. I don't dislike them at all, I just want my own time, and I need a lot of it, and this is all supported by the fact that during the majority of these parties I am sitting there twiddling my thumbs as everyone is speaking Spanish, and I don't speak it.

My tolerance is not helped by the fact that I receive frequent comments to the effect of ""You need to learn Spanish!""  and then when I try to understand what people are saying (I can get the gist every now and again because I speak French) I get laughed at for trying to do so.

Nevermind having done so about 10 times in the last two weeks and being unable to join in the conversation. So, despite her being annoyed I go to the gym and have a hard session, fueled by the anger of the position she is putting me in and making me feel like shit because I am all socialed out. I get back, say hi to everyone, go have a shower, and as I'm not in a good mood I just take a shower and lay down in bed, she comes in to have a talk, which starts out amicable but just turns in to the same bullshit as before, she is offended that I don't want to hang out with her family 3 times a week for hours on end at the drop of a hat. I tell her too bad, I can do 2 times a week, but any less and I'll go out of my way to go to the gym instead. She leaves and that's that.

"ek855e","1578199129","AITA for not wanting to pick up a pizza after working all day?","I work as a nanny for two kids. Both parents work 12 hour shifts, and the kids are 6y and 6mo. The 6yo is autistic, and has been a handful since the baby came along as she is not adjusting well to not being an only child at all. The baby is a handful because she’s, well, a baby who’s teething and exploring and learning that when she smacks people and pulls their hair they make funny noises and faces. 

I love kids, I love my job, and I love these two specific kids to death, but my god it is exhausting and the hours are long. Both parents commute 45 minutes to work so I have to be in their home an hour before their shifts begin—my workdays begin at the lovely hour of 5am. They end at 7pm, sometimes later depending on whether they actually make it out of work on time. 

I worked today. I’ve been up since 4am, and the kids were both particularly cranky and difficult today. The 6yo is getting frustrated with the lack of routine from being on holiday for so long, on top of already being frustrated with the baby. The baby is teething and had an upset stomach all day, accompanied by copious amounts of spit up and blown out diapers. 

By the time I got home at 8pm I was exhausted, sore, and smelly from being puked on and dealing with a poop-splosion. All I wanted to do was shower and curl up in bed with my BF and I’s puppy. But, my boyfriend tempted me with the offer of a pizza—on him. We ordered the pizza, I thanked him, and then headed off to go take a shower... until I was stopped.

He asked what I was doing, and when I said taking a shower he said, “But you have to go pick up the pizza?” Record scratch, what? 

I told him I was tired and asked if he could please pick it up because I just needed a quick shower to clean up and unwind. But no, that’s not fair, he buys I fly according to him. 

We argued a little bit about the fact that I’d worked all day while he’d gotten to sleep in and spend the day kicked back playing video games. He dug his heels in on the fact that “it’s only fair. I buy, you fly.” Eventually I got fed up and went and got the damn pizza. I didn’t even eat any, just dropped it on the counter and then resumed my plans of showering. 

After awhile we did talk and I expressed that I found it a little hurtful he couldn’t just make the short trip outside to get the pizza since I worked all day, and had to be up for work again tomorrow. And the next day. He apologized but still believes that it’s “the principle” of being fair. I think it’s bullshit he couldn’t go get the pizza to  let me relax a little bit, considering I always go to pick up takeout or cook when he’s worked all day and I haven’t. 

Now I’m wondering, AITA for not wanting to pick up a pizza my boyfriend paid for because I worked all day and he didn’t? He did pay for it so I can see the standpoint of it being “fair” but I feel like it was his offer, and sometimes being kind should take precedence over being fair.","False","Not the A-hole","46","149"

Brother [24M] and gf [20F] have been dating ~2 months. They've already had some weird boundary issues but this was something new that just gets under my skin. I've met her 4 times and 3 of those encounters were involving weird run in with their sexual exploration. 

I [21F] was sitting in my room and I heard them both enter the bathroom to shower at around 7pm. After the water stopped I heard the comb drawer open, hair dryer go off, and comb drawer close. (I know the sound very well since I hear it every day) The sound of the comb drawer drew my attention bc I know my brother has no use for a comb and his gf, as far as I know, have not been welcomed to use the combs by me or my mother. We do not share with random people for our own hygienic reasons. 

So after hearing all the sounds in the bathroom end and hearing them both walk back to my brothers room, I went to the bathroom to investigate to find that my comb was missing. I searched everywhere and asked my mom if she took it. She said no. Asked my dad and he had no reason to touch a comb.

Later brother and gf left the house for dinner and I found the comb back in my drawer. So I know the gf took the comb into my brothers room and used it, and my brother allowed it. 

So I am upset that my personal belongings are being used without my permission, but am I an asshole being kind of bent about a comb? I dont share a comb for hygienic reasons, but is it common for people to use other peoples combs?

Every year they ask a priest to come by their house to say a prayer and sprinkle holy water around their house. They have never asked us to go to their house before to get blessed ourselves but I recall many years ago being in attendance for it once so I know what it entails. I don't have any issues with being blessed and in fact I am slightly religious myself so I'm not completely against it.

Today, I woke up to my husband telling me his Mom wanted to see our daughter. It was out of the blue but we figured she wanted to see her before the end of the holiday season before everyone goes back to work. They came to our house to pick us up since we don't drive. While we were putting our daughter in her carseat my husbands mom asked us if we wanted to go see a movie or something and she can babysit our daughter. I told her no because we didn't feel like going anywhere and I didn't pump beforehand so she wouldn't have been able to feed her. Once she realized we were going to be at her house along with our daughter, she casually mentioned that the reason she wanted to see our daughter that day was because she asked a priest to come bless their house and our daughter needed to be in the house so that he could bless her too. I was stunned. I looked at my husband but all I could say was ""okay"". So we went to her house.

I tried to brush it off and go along with it but it didn't sit right with me at all. I want to make these types of decisions with my husband and not have it be forced on us in this way even if it's nothing official. I wanted to confront MIL with a ""Sorry, but we will not be participating"" but I have had issues with her in the past and prefer to keep the peace.

Right before the priest showed up, we had to change our daughters diaper so we went downstairs to do it. My FIL did come down to tell us the priest will come downstairs but I said ""no"" and shook my head. He said ""no?"" and then ""okay"". We heard the priest do his thing and we hid there until he was gone. My husband then went upstairs and when he came back down he told me his Mom was crying.

Hopefully by the end of this year. 

My bf of 6 years has been living alone for the past year now (graduated, got a job, moved out) and he's been lonely and wants me to move in. He's says its been six years and I want to see you all the time without having to worry about when you have to get home. He also always brings up the fact that this way we can have sex all the time (I honestly don't give a shit about sex as much as he does).

I want to live with him too but I want to live alone for a bit before that. I want to life with myself, I understand it is overrated (as my bf keeps saying) and want to discover myself. My parents are extremely controlling and my mom is very dependent on me and I am counting down the days till I can get out. 

I even came up with a compromise and said I will get an apartment nearby but basically spend most of my days with you. This compromise also helps me with my parents as they don't approve of my relationship anyway and the imminent conflict of me moving in with him is unavoidable otherwise. I'd really like to do this as peacefully as possible. 

I'm excited about the little things like decorating my room (was never allowed to do it), eating whatever I want (my mom doesn't eat meat so we don't eat meat in the house but I like chicken and eggs) and other little things like buying groceries for myself, cooking (I love cooking but my mom doesn't like with I make EVER so it really annoys me to cook when she's around).

She just ""never feel up to it"" I guess. Whatever, that's fine.

Thanksgiving we had sooo much food & I made her a plate for my MIL to take home to her. They left & about 20min later she's calling us up yelling about how she didnt get any mac n chz, she doesnt like dark turkey meat, green bean casserole, brussel sprouts, we only gave her a small amount of greens, & no mashed potatoes (which everyone ended up eating anyways.) Basically everything I put on the plate was stuff she didnt like & wasnt gonna eat.

I told her next time just show up & this problem could be avoided. Fast forward to Christmas. This time she did show up but complained about everything we had because she didnt like anything we were serving so she was all mad & huffy about how she was gonna go hungry now cuz she couldnt eat anything besides a small amount of pork roast.  She actually suggested that I shouldve asked her beforehand if she was okay with the foods we were gonna serve. 

I literally do not wanna invite her over anymore for dinners & dont wanna make her plates to take home anymore cuz I rly feel she's being very ungrateful.

My older brother also lived here but he went on an assignment for the military and has been gone almost a year. He paid the mortgage, my sister paid utilities, I babysat her child and their dogs. Childcare costs about 300 bucks a month where we live. Sister gets a new boyfriend, boyfriend starts paying mortgage and shoves brother's shit into a tiny room. Her boyfriend got injured at work immediately after moving in and was put on workmanship comp. He complains that I don't contribute because I have a part time job and I'm saving my money.

She cooks most of the time but sometimes I cook for everyone instead which is why this concerns both of us. I’m a vegetarian but my mom, dad & brother eat meat so I cook a vegetarian meal for all once a week & the rest of the time my mom cooks meat for the rest of the family & I do my own thing. 


My older brother also lives with us & his work schedule is 8-4 so generally he should be home for dinner. Before he leaves for work he usually tells my mom or she’ll ask if he’ll be home or not. 


When my brother says he won’t be home for dinner he definitely won’t be. The problem is more than 50% of the time when my brother says he’ll be home for dinner, he’s actually not. He probably eats dinner with us 2 times a week but says he’ll be here 5-6 times. He’ll text my mom at around 5-6 (we eat dinner usually around 7) with his change of plans. 


My mom’s a bit frustrated with this because she’ll go out to buy more ingredients to serve all of them for dinner & then he’ll say he won’t be home & they’ll end up with too many leftovers & had a wasted trip. 

It especially sucks when I cook for my mom & I as depending on what vegetarian dish I’m cooking, my dad will make something else instead for himself & my brother (e.g he’ll down a vegetarian pizza or egg fajitas no problem but he can’t eat spicy food so curry is off the table) so my dad will for example buy 2 steaks & end up only cooking 1. It especially sucks if they were frozen & my dad defrosted them since they can’t really be refrozen. 


My brother doesn’t think it’s a big deal & doesn’t understand why we get upset. I think my mom sees it as a lack of respect more than anything. My mom decided today they won’t go out to buy extra meat or take my brother into account when planning dinner. If what we are making is like Chili or something which will definitely serve 4+ no problem, but they don’t want to plan for him to be here anymore when half the time that he says he’ll be here, he isn’t. 


AITA for doing this? It’s not that my parents are mad he won’t be here for dinner often. They’re mad when he tells them that he will and then changes his plans 1-2 hours before dinners supposed to be. He gets upset if he comes home after work & there isn’t enough for him too & part of me personally feels for him, but at the same time I totally get my parents perspective.","1578206409.0","Not the A-hole","15","31"

So this happened literally over the course of the 29th to today. But over the entire time I've known her small disputes have happened ending up with her telling me to f--k off and blocking me just to friend me back a couple days later. In the recent months it has happened more and more frequently. 

29th :
Woke up, sent streaks and mornings out. So I usually get a morning back, and have a quick please try with each person unless they don't reply. So get no reply from her(Let's call her Megan) which is normal. I send a hello about 3 hours later and we have a quick conversation about random stuff when she asks what I think she should do for her A levels. Be it she already knows I won't choose her options as I believe it's your choice fully because it can decide your future. So Megan has a small go at me saying How's she's indecisive, autistic and how she can't decide what her favourite colour even is. So I just calmly tell her ask other people because I won't. She stops replying at that point.

30th:
 Today I basically only got a f--k off and block from her. 

3rd:
She unlocks me and attempts to talk to me but I give short, curt answers. To attempt to relieve the tension I send a couple memes and stuff but it's obvious neither of us are really in the mood to talk with the other. So we just say bye and stuff and me being me I say '**Sleep well Megan**'. As I do with everybody. Well most. There's some people I am good with and we tell each other to watch out for killers or whatever. So anyway. Later on around 7pm I get a message from her saying she's sorry for the freak out she's just frustrated because (and this is icing on the cake) her parents taking her to see a Broadway show she wanted to see.

4th:
I text her that morning to check up. Once again I ask how the options are going and she responds. '*Fine, but no f--king thanks to you*'. I answer with my belief again as its one thing I stand by that all important options should be made the one it affects the most. She then replies  with this. '*You know what? Just f--k off. I don't want to speak to your f--king rude a-- at the moment. All you do is refuse to help me.*' At this point I'm getting angry because I'm just standing by my beliefs and she's insulting me for it. So I reply with '**Look I get that you couldn't see your show but that doesn't mean that you can just have a massive go at me for it. I repeatedly just try to be a good friend but you consistently tell me to f--k off and block me. This exact behaviour is why at the moment I doubt there is a high chance of us being acquaintances, much less friends by the end of 2020**'She then blocked me.

"ek9l6l","1578207523","AITA for not giving a F*** anymore?","My Aunt HATES my grandmother and has stated to her face that she wishes she had died. Unfortunately her children have also adopted that same entitled sense of self. My male Cousin once called my grandmother ""an old bitch"" on the phone and my female cousin just doesn't bother with her at all. None of them have been to see her in the past 18 years despite living 5 minutes away... 15 if you walk.

My Uncle is not any better. He is her son, but he has no balls. He let's his wife tell him what to do, verbally, mentally, emotionally,  and we suspect physically abuse him. When I was younger it was easier to understand as she would always threaten to take their children if he tried to divorce her... but they're 26 and 23 now and he has no excuse. I always kinda felt for him as I know that sometimes abuse victims choose their abusers because they don't know how to not be abused. But any pity I had for him is GONE. 

Last August, I took my grandmother to her regular doctor's appointment as I always do. My grandmother's BP was really low and her pulse was even lower. She was taken directly to the ER VIA ambulance where the cardiologist told her she had to get a pacemaker put in IMMEDIATELY or her heart could fail.

My dad made multiple attempts to contact his brother and inform them that their mother was in the hospital and was having a surgical procedure as soon as possible and that she wanted to see him in case anything happens. He said he would talk to his family to see if someone could bring him ( he can't drive) He later replied stating that no one would drive him. I reached out stating I would be more than happy to get my brother ready and drive him myself or pay for an Uber to take him but he refused because his wife not only refused to take him, but refused to LET him go.

When my dad called him out on how ridiculous and hurtful it was to not visit his mother before a surgery and that anything could happen to her given the fact that she's 83 years old, he responded with "" I actually took my vows seriously when I got married and my wife doesn't want me visiting her right now. I will call her tomorrow after her surgery... if my wife's not home."" 

My grandmother thankfully made a full recovery and is doing well. I also understand that while what he did was hurtful (my grandmother cried before her surgery) he is still her son, and insists that I still should be forgiving and understanding of the situation. When I made it clear in a nice but firm tone, that under NO circumstances will I be talking or acknowledging their existence in any way. She insists that I am the asshole for not giving the respect ""due"" to my uncle.

My dad sides with me in private, but scolds me in front of his mom... I guess the no balls thing runs in the family. 

So reddit, AITA for cutting off the dead limb from my personal family tree?

"ek9o2w","1578208082","WIBTA for not wanting to go to college ?","I’m on my phone so sorry for the any formatting issues. 

I’m (18f) and just recently graduated high school (2019). Before graduating my whole high school career wasn’t pleasant, and I struggled & still am from some mental health issues. During my junior and senior year however things got significantly worst as I was realizing I was heading in the world. I was hospitalized many times during these two years in school, had panic attacks and would just breakdown and cry. So my idea was to take a year off before really committing to the whole college thing. My mother however shuts any and every idea of me not being in school down. Which lead me to going to a ‘private’ college and staying in dorm. Even though I would’ve rather going to a community college, my mom wanted me to “at least experience dorm life”.

I will admit going to the school was great in the beginning and I really loved it. But as the semester went on it became very hard for me. I would study, ask my professors for help and take advantage of the tutoring services my school had. However to no avail nothing was helping, so I was basically at this school for nothing. Which took a toll on my mental health because I felt stupid basically. I began asking my mother if after this semester at this school could I transfer to a community college. We were paying a lot of money for me to be at this school even with grants and the scholarship I had and it didn’t seem fair to make her pay that if it wasn’t working out. 

She told me no every time, and that every freshman feels that way and that it was part of the experience. So I just had to suck it up, until the holidays rolled around. Since it was after finals my mother wanted to see my grades which I reluctant to show her because I knew I failed my classes. I straight up told her, to which she told me to “get the f outta her face” and she left me.

I told him I was, because then I was going through the ""baby gay"" phase where everyone had to know. He told me he was gay as well.

I didn't want to pursue anything with him as I was seeing someone else, but spiraling from that first conversation came a questionable relationship between he and I where he would text me every day and I would feel pressured to answer back. Consequently I have shared some of my deepest, darkest, secrets with him only because he has shared his and I felt obligated to reciprocate. We talk about boys because he is in the baby phase still. This makes me uncomfortable. He texts me every day and is the only person I have on snapchat with an emoji next to his name (meaning we text **a lot** *per day*, for you boomers out there). 

This has created a situation where I feel I am being held conversationally hostage. He has called me his best friend for over a year and it makes me uncomfortable. He is very sensitive and takes things literally and out of context because his self esteem is very low. He is very clingy and if I ask for space he takes it as a personal insult. 

I have dodged most requests for us to hang out at school events, go see movies, etc. because I am not interested in being friends. Over winter break he made me promise to do something with him, I did. I didn't want him to spiral into a deep depression again, he has done so many times, and at those times the volume of texts increases, the contests are all fishing for self-assurance, gratification, validation. I don't think I owe him this, it all feels very manipulative. 

He has worn a pink bandanna to school because he thinks I'll think it's cute, and has told me many times that he thinks I'm cute.

The few other friends that I have make jokes about us being together at my expense, and I do not appreciate it.

(mobile so bad formatting, etc)


For context, I (15M) came out to this rather close friend (15-16M I actually don’t know now lol, both sophomores) last summer over text. This friend has allegedly saved screenshots of me telling him.

Small conflicts

After the school year (this current school year) had started, him and I were getting off a bus after a school activity, he had asked me a stupid question which was rather funny, and I wanted to tell our friends about it (nothing serious, he was just wondering if two people-who were actually siblings, which he wasn’t aware of- were dating or something). He proceeds to, apparently jokingly, say that if I said anything that he’d show his screenshots to everyone. I don’t think much of it at this time because I thought it was a joke, so I didn’t say anything. After this had happened he started being more liberal in his “joke” threats, and basically plays that card every time he thinks I’m annoying him. 

The main thing

Near the end of the first term, we were in a practice for our school activity and I believe I had just made some paper fans or something and started dancing with them. He, while laughing, chases me around the school and eventually takes the fans and rips them and throws them away. I do get kinda mad, but don’t show it; I responded by putting his backpack in a recycling bin, and a clean one at that. He then says I can’t get a ride from him (very cold weather and I lost my jacket that day, and my house is rather far and he always gave me rides). I thought he was joking as he was laughing while saying so, so I walked with him outside to get to his car but he started running away from me. At this point I thought he was serious and started basically pleading for a ride because it was really freezing outside. At THIS point he decides to play the screenshot card. Then I just decided I had enough, so I walked home myself. He then got into his mom’s car and drove by me asking if I wanted a ride, I decline, etc. He gets his mom to ask me, I decline again. 


While I’m walking home, this friend texts me about how he was joking but I’m pissed off so I call him an asshole and such. After this he says it’s my fault because I do annoying things like, and I QUOTE “outing me to our friends for not knowing (brother and sister pair at school) were siblings and not dating”. So I eventually just cut contact with him. Now I’m kinda feeling bad for blowing up in his face, feeling like this is an issue I shouldn’t be caring about, and also feeling like he deserves it all at once. I’ve probably spent the most time with him out of anyone else in my school, and we were friends since our first year of middle school when he didn’t know I was gay and whatnot.

By the time I came home everything was already cleaned up and nobody bothered mentioning to me that the bookshelf fell and the aquarium was broken until I spotted the water damaged pictures I had of one of my favorite artist sitting on the kitchen table. These pictures were received from special fan events that I had gone to and hold a lot of sentimental value to me because this artist has gotten me through some tough times. After discovering these photos is when I hear about the shelf falling and when I proceeded to go near the shelf to find the rest of my collection.

Instead of finding them, it turns out my mom threw away my photos because according to her they were already wet so apparently they now are useless and she threw them all away, all without informing me. Nobody including my siblings (who all had phones) bothered to send a simple text or call informing me what happened and asking me if it was ok to throw away my photos. 

These photos meant a lot to me so when I found out they were in the trash bin already I became super irrational and started bawling my eyes out because I liked them a lot and it was super upsetting to hear that they were thrown out. 

My dad had to take me out to the alleyway and I had to dig through the trash while crying to find my pictures which had been mixed with the regular trash. Some of the pictures I found in that trash can weren't even that wet but became dirty from being mixed with the other trash. When I finished collecting everything that I could salvage I went home and started yelling and arguing with my mom about why she thought it was ok to just throw out my things without even telling me. Not once did she apologize about throwing them out but instead argued back about why I would even want them anymore because they're just now ""wet useless pieces of paper"". I know accidents happen and all and I can't change my photos back to their original state now but it broke me when they were just thrown away without permission.

I did not like being called cute. It made me uncomfortable and I found it weird. I didn't want to make a big deal, so I asked some guy I work with what to do about it. I didn't want to cause problems over being called cute, but I don't want comments about my appearance at all. Next thing I know, everyone is asking me if I think this man is creepy. It's big gossip.

So... we had a NYE party at our house with my long time friends. People attending to the party were also my housemate’s friends since we went to the same high school. 

My housemate (I’ll call her Sera from now on.) went back to his hometown so she was missing the party. People came, drinks were drank and people were drunk. Still everyone is in the living room and it’s not a whole house situation. Time gets and late and people are getting sleepy. The sleeping arrangement is three people on my bed, three people on Sera’s bed and another three at the couch. 

The pissy guy (Tyler) decided to sleep. Went to Sera’s room and falled asleep. Time passes by and another friend of mine that is going to sleep next to him decides to sleep aswell. He goes to the room, comes right back and tells with a shocked face “Tyler is pissing to bed.” Me thinking I would find a guy pissing on his sleep, instead I see a guy standing, dick pulled out, fully(?) awake guy.

We all rushed to the room, shaked him told him to go to the WC and he decides kitchen is the WC. We all go there aswell tell him to come back to his senses he insists he is already at the toilet and shows the bin trying to prove he is there. 

Anyways he goes back to his place we gather around the bed brainstorming about what to do, we pour flour and baking soda to the filthy places of the bed. Since we were also half drunk not realizing the side of the bed also was pissy so we pour it and go back to sleep. After we wake up we check it and the bed has turned yellow on the places he pissed. We vacuum the flour and baking soda and to our chance most of the yellow comes off with them but the sides are still yellow.

Let’s come to the AITA part. I don’t plan on telling my friend about the incident because it might cayse her to get mad (rightfully) and cause her to to ask me not to call my friends again.

It’s basically small apartments with a dining room where they serve meals. A year or two ago, they added on a separate building, with slightly larger apartments and a better dining room, so we often go there to eat with her since she’s allowed to eat anywhere she likes since she’s a resident.

Now, I have long hair. I like having long hair, personally. This, however, creates the issue that whenever we go to lunch or dinner with G, my mother (G’s daughter, we’ll call her M) always comes to me a few days later and tells me that G said that she would prefer I put my hair up when we eat. I can understand this for cleanliness reasons, but I am not a messy eater, and my hair is never in the way of my eating, nor does it get in or near my food. I always make sure it stays behind my shoulders for cleanliness when I am eating, so I see no other reason for her to expect this of me, besides her personally disliking how it looks or thinking it’s rude to have long hair down when eating.

Before you say I’m just being rebellious, I’m not. I couldn’t care less about doing something because G or M asked me to, but I do have actual reasons for not wanting to put my hair up. I actually hate having my hair up, I always have, it’s just really uncomfortable to me and I hate the feeling of something dangling off the back of my head, plus I personally think I look bad with my hair up. Because of this, I never put my hair up unless it is for a formal occasion, which these meals are not. 

The reason I am asking AITA is because recently, M has been getting more annoyed with me about it whenever G says something. The fact that they are both clearly annoyed by my non-compliance makes me think maybe I am TA, but I also think I’m not TA because they have no reason to ask me to do this other than what I mentioned above. I understand if G doesn’t like it, but if it’s not causing any issues with dinner besides someone personally not liking how it looks, then I don’t feel I have any reason to have to put it up. I have spoken to M about this multiple times, and she has no reasons other than “G wants you to”. I also find it very rude that G, instead of asking me herself, talks to M about her opinion of my appearance behind my back. 

For clarity, M does not have the same desire for me to put my hair up when I eat at home, she just thinks I should when we visit G because G wants me to.

He admitted that it was crappy of him to treat me like he was. I said that I'd try and be more careful with how I said things.

We moved back to our home state and started to reconnect. We had our once a week game nights and that was too much pressure on him. So canceled those. We still hung out in person.

I normally an fairly calm, and when I yell at someone I try to keep it to only what I'm mad about. The game was a small thing, but after years of being dissed I snapped.

I've wanted to get this off my chest or a while because this is ripping me apart inside.

My uncle of 53 years old is dying of terminal bowel cancer and isn't expected to make it to 2021.

But this is also the mane who used to drive almost 70 mph down 30mph roads and swerve close to parked cars/trucks just to watch an 8-year-old me cry and laugh at me for crying about it. Then calling me wimp for crying about it. When I turned to my teen years and he had to be the one to pick me up from school then he used to drive up to girls on the way home asking if they wanted to help me ""loose my male cherry"". Which was incredibly uncomfortable for me and I instantly left the car when he tried to pull that crap and walked home.

For years nobody in my family believed me about this until my aunt saw him do it once. But nothing changed. Nobody was willing to confront him because he was the youngest in my mother's family and the ""baby"" of the 5 siblings. He has never worked a day in his life and just sucked money from my grandparents and his own siblings - my single mom included - all his life.

When my aunt passed away and left a lot of money to my mom he turned the rest of their siblings against her and called her a money-grabbing c\*\*t. Cut contact for almost 3 years. He was allowed to live in my aunt's old house and utterly ruined it in 3 years. There was so much trash and litter in there we needed boots to walk through the kitchen with so many empty cans of Strongbow and Redbull.

Now that he's had this diagnosis though everyone acts like nothing has happened and everything is forgiven. When my mom began t get some distance during this he bought himself a puppy and demanded she come clean up its mess since he's too sick from chemo to do so. And she does. Everyday.

Whenever he's in our house I either leave, go upstairs or refuse to speak with him. And he's now been using that to try and call me a heartless sociopath. My mother has been begging me to forgive him as he hates to ""rock the boat"" in our family and never defended me when his actions all those years ago were found out. I know he is dying and I would never wish his condition on anyone. But I'm privately thinking to myself ""good riddance.""

After 4 hours of tossing and turning, I decided to turn off the electricity bc the breaker box is in our room.  They immediately were thrown off by it and they left disappointed.  I haven’t talked to my roommate about it yet, but I assume he’ll be understanding because he felt bad for being so loud.  I feel bad now, but I couldn’t bear the noise and I was exhausted.  AITA?

"ekb44n","1578218181","AITA for being hesitant to marry my partner before we move?","My partner and I have been together since high school. The last four years have been a long-distance relationship while they work part-time at Starbucks and go to a college in our home city, while I go to a school a couple of hours away.

Now, after five years of being together, I am about to graduate. Earlier this year, I received a very competitive offer in an industry I’m passionate about (which is fortunate because I realized too late in my college education that I wasn’t passionate about what I was learning, so I was banking on using the degree to get a job in a different industry). This job is in a beautiful city a long way away from where we live (we currently live in the south, but the job is in the midwest).

Here are the issues, though. My partner has anxiety and, while they have made great strides to overcome the challenges of living with anxiety, they still lack many of the basic skills necessary to be an autonomous human being. At 20 years old, they can only drive on relatively non-busy roads (ie not the interstate), and they still live with their parents who generally shelter them from the realities of the outside world. Their family always drives them to school, to work, and rarely (if ever) allows them to confront their shortcomings (much less the anxiety that causes them) in a constructive way. Their family is also poor (leaving them without their own car and not allowing them to seek therapy), fairly dysfunctional, and fights a fair amount - I suspect this is a huge cause of or contributing factor to their anxiety. This has resulted in them wanting to get a marriage license before we move, to take the power away from their parents and symbolize the start of our life together.

With the amount I’d be making, we’d easily be able to live within walking distance of where they work (Starbucks’s relocation policy allows for very easy relocation to any desired store), and they would be able to attend classes online for an accredited degree, which Starbucks provides for free. The only issue is, with just how much I’d be risking by taking them with me due to the discrepancy in life experience and skills, I want to wait a little while to get married until we’re on a level playing field as two independent human beings who COULD survive without the help of each other if something bad happened. Because I would want them to have a car to practice driving in, I would be able to give them the car I’m currently driving (which my parents paid off) while I put a down payment on a car if and only if the finances allow for it.

I see myself as a very important factor in my partner’s development of self-autonomy. And I love them more than I’ve ever loved anyone else. As much as I don’t want to be their “savior,” I want to put them in a position to grow and mature the way their family has rendered them unable to. All I ask is that the marriage commitment waits a little while.","False","Not the A-hole","8","27"

It was 4 hours a day everyday and the kids were from 3-6 years old. As it was not a day care and every stranger from the street could walk in the building(they had a room in the building)I would sit there and won't leave the building.

During this time I see the teacher and her help are having issues controlling the kids and I try to help(like watching the kids not go out of the building,the building has 2 doors and some older kids go out from the back door which is dangerous because it leads to a busy street.) After 2 months they accepted a 2.5 year old which was weird but it was not my business. The 2.5 year old started hitting other children and at first when the teacher asked him he would apologize and hug it out.

But gradually as there was no other consequences to him beating others he started ignoring the teacher and my daughter at the time was really upset and didn't want to go there anymore.she was 3 by the way. I asked the management what were they planning to do and they said it would stop in few months and they feel what they were doing is enough. I got angry and to be honest even raised my voice. I finally declared I won't being my daughter there the days the other kid was there(mind you the kids were not there) and the management told me don't bother coming at all. I said fine by me and took my daughter somewhere else.

But, I told other moms I won't bring my daughter back as some of the kids were her friends and we weren't close enough to go to each other's homes.

My parents are so loving and they really care about me but it’s gets so annoying and frustrating when you know they’re really trying to make you happy. They always ask me if to bring me something and even when I explicitly say I do not want it, they still bring it. This applies to everything from food to clothes to everything. I’m on a diet so please don’t get me when ordering pizza, they still do! I’m a bit picky when it comes to clothes but they still get me things I don’t need or won’t wear cuz they’re just trying show their love to me.

They treat me like a fucking child (24yo here). When I say NO to something I fucking mean it. It’s such a waste of money and effort on the leftover food and things that I won’t ever use. Why can’t they understand that?? All I want is for them them to love and accept me. I’m gay btw and we talked about it 2 years ago but it didn’t turn out well, they still support me however and I appreciate it and I don’t blame them for not understanding as they’re quite religious. That doesn’t mean that they have to buy me and treat me like that to make me feel better. I don’t care for materialistic stuff, I care about genuine love and acceptance. 

When they got me stuff this Christmas, I got so angry, started shouting and threw the cake my mom got me on the ground because I just couldn’t hold it anymore and obviously I feel bad now and at the same time won’t bring the gay/acceptance topic as it will make them more sad/disappointed and we just don’t talk about it anymore.

"ekbm66","1578221786","AITA for not wanting to make my father an advent calendar?","So my (27f) parents divorced a few years ago but are still living together, partly for financial reasons and partly because they coexist in the same dwelling far more harmoniously as platonic housemates than as husband and wife.

My mother is an exceptional woman. She worked a physical job while chronically ill to provide me with opportunities for a good education and a safe place to grow up. She also was the contributor of the vast majority of the time, attention, energies, resources, and interaction involved in raising me. She is loving and caring and the most devoted, amazing mother I've ever seen. 

My father, not chronically ill, played very little of a role in my upbringing, despite living under the same roof. Our interaction was minimal, and he often complained (in front of me) when Mum would (albeit rarely) ask reasonable things of him regarding parenting (eg attend parent teacher night in my final year of high school), saying it was inconvenient-- usually due to it interrupting some televised sporting event or his being tired after work. 
He hid parts of his salary from my sick mother to furnish his smoking and drinking habits (He is not an alcoholic). He was abusive to my mother in many different ways, and by extension to me, but expected to be loved by us both all the same.

Now to the question. My mother hand made me an advent calendar when I was a kid (made 24 bags and filled them with some lollies, a toy, and/or a scratchie), and the tradition carries on now even though I've left home. Some five or so years ago I decided to start one for her, too, since I finally had money to do it. I put quite a bit of effort into it each year, as she does with mine, and it's a lovely arrangement that makes December a joy for us. I didn't make one for my father, because he didn't have anything to do with my advent calendar's creation. Still, he was very hurt to not receive one from me as well, and sulked and occasionally complained about feeling left out to my mother. I ended up making him one too just to keep him off my mother's back.

I believe that you reap what you sow (or don't, in this case). Him not receiving an advent calendar seems perfectly reasonable to me and commensurate to the efforts he has put in as a father, but maybe I'm wrong. AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","13","31"

Last summer my bf (22) and I(20) went to his grandparents house because he wanted to see them and we couldn't afford going anywhere else on vacation, we took his brother with us (16).

I already saw his grandparents on multiple occasions but never really talk to them, but they always seemed nice.

So the first day, while we were eating, my bf told them that 2 days I made chinese food for my bf, his brother and parents (i'm half Chinese). His grandmother immediately said something about Chinese people eating dogs, I was chocked, and everyone laugh a little bit. Then she just continued saying that Chinese people eat dog over and over. I didn't know what to say, because even if I'm used to these kind of stuff, I never had anyone I know saying this. 

But the next day, she just continued repeating this racist stuff, and the day after too.

I told my bf that it really hurts me and that I didn't know what to do, and he told me that I shouldn't care because she's old etc, I asked him if he could just tell her not to do this in front of me. He said no because he respects his grandparents, and I was TA for not understanding this, and I should tell her by myself.

I was too shy to talk to her and I was feeling ashamed not standing for myself. I know I should have said something. But I just tried to forget about this, but she repeated the ""joke"" , this time my bf's brother told her to stop, and she stopped.

But first a small explanation: I am looking for a job and have been looking for a job for months so I can help my family but they are super overprotective and won’t just ‘let me work anywhere with all kinds of people.’.My hands are tied because even though I want to work and help ,they have all these terms and conditions about what place of work is appropriate for a girl that I am losing hope I’ll find anything they approve of.

My mom doesn’t work nor has any desire to do so even though we are not in our best financial situation.
Today we needed to buy groceries but my dad (who’s the only breadwinner in a house of 5 adults ) had left no money for groceries.
So my mom comes  at me and asks me to loan her 20 dollars so we could buy groceries.I give it to her ask if she could tell her cousin (who does her groceries for us since she’s ToO TiReD AlL THe TiMe) to buy me something for breakfast. She tells me no, there are not enough money.
Okay.I understand and leave it at that. After 20 minutes I go in the kitchen, she had apparently not heard me come in and I hear her talking to her cousin about some missing packs of cigarettes. They resolve it on the phone and I ask her about it when she finally hangs up,she tells me  she had told him to buy not one,not two BUT THREE packs of cigarettes for her. So I say ‘We had money for three packs of cigarettes but not for a croissant for me ?’. She tells me to straight up to ‘fuck off’.
This kind of dismissive short and rude response got me heated , I waited until my dad came home told him all about it and basically had a huge argument with her about how she should start working if she wants to afford 3-4 packs of cigarettes a day and the maid my dad pays so she can sit on her ass all day and essentially do NOTHING.
It didn’t end up well and now everybody is against her.

Now she’s telling me how I’m a coward and a backstabber for involving everyone in it just for a ‘fucking croissant’. To me it’s about the the fact that she’s waisting groceries money on her expensive addiction.

So it's Sunday and my parents and I attend church because we're serving in ministries.(my other family members already attended that day so they didn't follow).

So after service ends, I stay back to clean up the area and keep sound equipment. When I exit church, I notice my parents were no where to be found and so was their car.

I call them 5 times each, and they don't pick up. So I call my brother and tell him I decided to walk home. As I'm walking home, about 10mins into the walk, my father comes with an umbrella to bring me to the car. The laugh it off but don't apologise and just claim they were talking to their friends and therefore forgot me. I should probably also mention it was raining heavily and they had drove about 5 minutes and only stopped when my brother called them. They didn't even call me at this point. 

We reach home and I'm pissed. They didn't apologise and even laughed at the fact I had decided to walk home in the pouring rain. My mom tells me to get changed in a very matter-of-fact manner, and I reply in an annoyed tone. My father loses his cool and shouts at me. Telling me it was very disrespectful. I point out hee forgot his fucking son at church because he was talking to friends and he plays it of as not a big deal. I argue it was a big deal that he forget his fucking flesh and blood.

He gets angry that I challenge him and shouts at me even more and at this point Ive snapped. I pointed out to him that Im not allowed to forget chores but he's allowed to forget his son.

With all due respect it feels weird going to mom's friend's house, I mean he's got his own life and interests and I seem to bother him most of the time. He also doesn't really want to talk or interact with me, not that I'd know what to say since we're not super close and he's like 50.

A few months ago, my husband approached me and asked how I would feel if he went on a boys trip with two of his friends. In the moment, I assumed he meant spending a weekend away gambling or seeing a race. I know him to be responsible and I trust him, so I told him I wouldn't have a problem with it. He brought it up so casually I was sure it was something like that.

He then revealed that this boys trip was actually a week in Beijing.

I was stunned. For context, we live in Germany. It's not exactly a short distance to go and we are not swimming in cash. I was floored that he seemed to think neither was an issue, nor should I be concerned that we would have limited contact during that time. One of his friends had been there before, he said, and could help navigate their way around. Plus, it wasn't going to be ""that expensive"" with the right planning. He further explained that leaving me alone wouldn't be so bad because I had left him alone for three weeks when I went back to the States to visit my parents.

But when I went to visit my parents, we could always reach each other. He knew I was safe and in a familiar environment with people who could take care of me if anything should happen. To me, this trip feels entirely different. After all the time we spent apart in our relationship, the fact that he would want to go on this huge trip with his friends (and not me) really hurts. Somehow, I feel like trips of this size should be reserved for the two of us. He had also never previously expressed any desire to visit China, but wouldn't even hear of reconsidering and picking somewhere within Europe.

About 5 months ago Bill got into separate arguments with both of us, on separate occasions but within the same week. The content is irrelevant/stupid, but our arguments tend to get heated. Bill ended up ghosting on me and Frank pretty much the entire time since. This has been the longest time with me, and he’s never done it with Frank, which is difficult considering they live together. But at this point they still haven’t spoken in over 5 months. According to Frank, Bill has avoided him at all costs in the household. He says hi to him, and he just walks to his room like no one said anything. I should also mention our circle of guy friends are extremely open with each other. We talk about our issues openly and at this point Bill is the only one who doesn’t. He prefers to ignore things until they blow over. 

Anyways, I mentioned the situation to a separate friend, Kevin, who mentioned it to his wife, that both Frank and I haven’t spoken to Bill in a while. Kevin is also in our circle and friends with all of us. The conversation was a venting/logistics issue because the wedding planning is coming up and Bill has disappeared. Bill finally came around on New Years. When I asked him where’s he been, his answer was “busy”.  No sorry or explanation. I was going to leave it at that, but I know it was a bs answer.

Years ago at college I (30sF) shared a room with ""Kate"" (30sF) for a couple weeks. I was there only for a couple months for a project, so I spent most of my time focusing on that project and not much on making friends. Kate and I talked a bit but she was there for a longer time and had other friends. After I left, we stayed in touch, but not much more than occasional text messages. Afterwards we have always lived more than 1000 miles away from each other.

A couple years later, I was in the neighborhood and decided to meet up with her. It was only for one night, and we had some nice conversations but at least to me, nothing profound.

The last time however, I immediately felt like I didn't like visiting her. She seems to think we have this really strong friendship which I cannot reciprocate. I feel like we've grown apart and I cannot be the friend she thinks I am. She seems to put me on a pedestal (""You're so smart!""

Old tools, Paperwork, Paint cans, Just general stuff you find in a garage but packed into a huge shelving unit. She is able to park her car in there and there is still plenty of room so this isn’t a serious hoarding situation just a small one. 

With my friends permission and help, we sorted through everything to make more room and just generally clean up her place. Any paperwork or stuff that looked important she determined what to do with it. There was receipts in there from over 10 yrs ago. I salvaged and kept anything that was useable. So much was rusted and covered in dust, as it looked like it hadn’t been used, much less touched, in many years. There was about 2 full trash bins worth of “junk”

She asked her dad to come get some stuff that he may want and he was a little upset about me going through his things. He was upset I threw away nuts, bolts, nails (rusted, and there was a whole jar full of good ones I kept).  We ended up taking some water damaged manuals for a tractor and other equipment he had out of the trash! Because he “needed” them. 

I feel bad. My friend said not to worry about it because if it was that important he would have done this himself years ago. Her brother had just left it all as is so I do understand how he feels this is a violation of his space, but I feel like this is her home now. I’m a bit torn since we haven’t taken the trash to the curb yet and have been considering trying to salvage more for him to take. And there’s still a whole other half of the garage to go through.

My daughter was born June 17th 11:20PM 

She was born 24 years ago.

I stayed with my daughters mother for 4 years after our daughter was born.

Our separation was *difficult* to say the least.

My daughters mother was dating someone else not even a year later, less than 3 years later she had a child.

I saw my daughter once every two weeks.



When our daughter turned 13 she had a little bit  of a break, shoplifting, drinking and smoking.

Eventually she was diagnosed with split personality.

When she was 17 it got extremely bad and she wouldn't go therapy.

She  stayed with me for a week, when I woke up she had stolen all my money from my wallet and had gone back to her mothers.

I texted her telling her If she didn't come back within the next hour she has run out of chances.

She didn't reply.

We haven't spoken since then.

She recently reached out to me, shes getting married and wants me to attend.

I dont plan on reaching back out due to the past.

I only had ten minutes to light food shopping so I went to the Deli section and took a number. There were no other customers waiting for orders and there were about three deli employees behind the counter. They were seemingly doing other tasks but after I took a number, a male employee said he would get to me when he was done with what he was doing.  

Nevertheless, I waited a good six minutes and he still hadn't waited on me yet. The other two woman ignored me despite me standing right at the counter, waiting patiently. When it was apparent, he wasn't getting to me anytime soon, I walked away disgusted. I picked up some items and checked out all within the ten minute window.

As I drove away, I called the store and asked to speak to the manager on duty. I told her that the employees made me wait too long and that even though they were engaged in other tasks, I should have been waited on as there were no other customers waiting. She said she would go and address the issue with the deli workers. I hung up unsatisfied, because I feel I deserved compensation.

"ekd2k2","1578231286","AITA for making snide remarks about my pregnant GF's cooking skills?","So, today my GF and I both decided to have pancakes for breakfast. We have had a lot of pancakes recently, I usually make them as I have more routine, I also wake earlier usually due to health issues and she being pregnant (date of arrival is in 2 weeks) is usually happy about that. I may be a little bit of a control freak in the kitchen. 

She likes cooking together. I like it for being something to do together, but I really don't like her, well, kitchen proficiency. I have had to up my game in the past years for my job (cooking at a group home for the mentally challenged) and was probably better at it before, she was more of a baking gal. She works at a pharmacy and I guess there are some similarities. Weighing shit, stirring shit and whatnot. 

So, back to the pancakes. She had done them once before: To my surprise and light shock she just dumped all the flour in right at the beginning. She had often used instant flour before, which is really easy to handle and basically won't form clumps. This was regular wheat flour. I saw it and asked if that's how she dies that, my mom taught me to give in the flour little by little while stirring, often even using a scree. She said yes. OK. 

The dough was full of clumps. No exaggeration, it was just awful. I was a little pissed then and definitely made some kind of remark, but I think we were fine afterwards. 

She unrelatedly also told me her friend was only letting her do one pancake when she was visiting before doing the rest herself, it's a very OCD kinda friend but still, I can see why. She's not much better with frying them. 

And that I can understand no problem, she rarely does them. But when she without asking proceeded to dump all the flour in first and doing the dough while I handled my mother on the phone, stirred it like shit (clumps, no bubbles whatsoever, had to ask if she really added water with gas) and, as it turned out, also did not put in enough flour even after a second round of stirring that took care of the clumps, I couldn't help but get angry. I tried to let it go, but she came join me and was like ""oh"" when she saw the abomination that was our first pancake. For the second one, I was internally ohing, as it was obviously missing flour  after stirring a second time. She was like ""that one looks better"". 

I informed her that of course this one is better, as I've stirred it a second time because she dropped in all the flour in the beginning and there were lots of clumps. 

She went quiet and obviously felt guilty. She was just standing there 45 degrees behind me to my side, the way I always stood there when my dad threw a tantrum when he failed at fixing shit around the house with my ""help"" (mostly as an emotional punching bag and scapegoat). 

This is where i stopped to think: I'm the same kind of asshole. 

And, perhaps fueled by that thought, I said: ""That's why I prefer cooking alone. Controlled conditions."" 

She said ""then have fun cooking alone""

Haven't talked since...

E. Geez reddit you be scary. Thanks for the guys and gals giving constructive criticism, also the tough ones.

 Much appreciated. Talked to my girlfriend today, apologized. Asked her to call me out on this kind of shit, as it really needs to stop. She said she felt like she should talk back but is reminded of her dad, and it always made everything worse.  But she agreed she'd try to and we're good. I probably project a lot, I do have quite a bit to worry about that I definitely will not discuss here for the sake of my very sanity. 

Also, the talk I had with my dad was a little cathartic. To the people trying to spin me to be an alcoholic of sth you need to drop it, I quit smoking and reduced alcohol to pretty much once or twice a month in moderate amounts, as my health required it. Helped with mood swings a little. 

For all the people saying I'm a terrible human being, father and whatnot: I really think you guys need to take a step back and ask yourself if you are any better. I'm actually trying to improve, despite the general consensus that I am unwilling to change anything. I still struggle to see where I actually said I won't change. 


However, I can be a bean counter and there are things that are just not factual about me: I did not enjoy what I did, no matter how many try to say I did.

I share an apartment with a couple. We are fantastic friends and have been incredibly close for a long time. 

I’m from the east coast but we live together on the west coast. Because of the financial/ work situation of most friends/ family, I never see them. Usually just like once every two years 

But again, not bad because I’m super close with my roomies 

One of the parents asked if they could host Christmas this year and then talked to me and I agreed. It was also one of their birthdays and someone we went to college with moved back from abroad so We ended up having a completely full apartment for about two weeks 

It was overweening as we only have a living room, so I ended up hosting someone in my room, then two people in the living room, and people visiting from nearby hotels 

It was a lot and we agreed it was super super stressful. I helped host the entire time as I knew everyone going, and although they were my roomies “guests” I like them a lot and it wasn’t a chore beyond the general tiredness 

Vacation is over and we have all voiced how exhausted we are, and they said they they don’t want to do any more hosting for a while (they generally do all of it). I agreed but just got a message from a Highschool friend that he has vacation with his job for a week and would love to come see me for the first time 

He can’t afford Airbnb/ hotel, this would already be financially taxing 

And he is also not a mutual friend of my roomies - but we have been friends for 15 years and he lives abroad  

His vacations are assigned and after this January one, he would not get off until March (when it’s impossible for me) or January next year 

I am not visiting him this year nor is it possible 

It’s SUPER last minute and i don’t know how to respond 

I’d love to see him, and don’t want to hurt his feelings but also I don’t want to piss my roommates off -I know if they ask, they’ll feel morally obligated to say yes, but that doesn’t make it right

I'm not very overweight but I've never been thin and have a large chest which she hates. Ive also struggled with eating disorders in the past and to this day. Anyway, throughout the week it's more of the usual casual criticisms of my looks and personality and I put up with it all, all the while putting on a good face for her never ending pictures (fine it's the holidays). When she's taking pictures she keeps criticizing my faces saying they dont look normal while I'm just doing my best to take the best picture I can. It's also worth mentioning we are eating a lot throughout the week which is making me really anxious because of my food problems. By the last day of the week I am thoroughly exhausted from this anxiety and socializing. I feel ugly for lack of a better word.

Every year my grandfather takes the entire family on a luxury vacation in January. The problem is, these trips are always centered around outdoor activities that can't be navigated by a wheelchair. As a kid who couldn't say no, I ended up sitting in the hotel room on most of these trips while everyone else went skiing, hiking etc. 

When I got old enough to ask for a vacation to an easier place to navigate like some cities I wanted to visit like NYC, Toronto, Vancouver etc. my grandfather and uncles dismissed me out of hand because we ""spend so much time indoors when we're not on vacation, why go to a city to spend time inside buildings?"" 

So I just said fuck it I won't go anymore. I thought maybe my absence would help my family get the picture but they've now gone on the trip for years without me, sometimes even talking to me about certain hikes they did **as if I were there**. Usually they remember when I asked how I climbed the cave wall in the chair. 

So now grandpa says he's getting too old for these trips, so he's going to take the entire family to a far off place for yet another outdoorsy hiking trip. I told him unless we go somewhere accessible to me that I'd be sitting it out.

My wife is currently the only one of the four of us with a job (only mentioned because workload means she doesn't have the energy to pitch in - financial concerns aren't part of this, they make rent and that satisfies us and I'm currently jobsearching). I do all the cleaning that isn't in the other couple's bedroom, aside from one of them cleaning the bathrooms once a month because I can't do that, and cat related things because he is their cat.

I can't calm down when the house isn't clean, so I clean top to bottom aside from the bathrooms every day. I do all the dishes, theirs and ours both. I clean and tidy the living room that the other couple use most of the time. I recognize that my antsiness about things not being clean is my problem and so I take steps to fix it, I'm not angry with them about it even if I do wish they'd thank me a little more and do the bathrooms more often. We also buy all the major cleaning supplies and trade off between couples stocking up on paper goods, no issue there. My problem is this... I have a hard time making friends and I honestly just want them to like me. But they seem more and more vaguely annoyed about it? And I'm wondering if it's coming across like I'm trying to make them look or feel bad... If I bring it up they're the type of people to brush it off so I really don't know what to do. Should I clean less? Stopping doing their dishes while still doing ours feels so passive aggressive to me and while it's reasonable to leave your dishes for maybe a day, it really bothers me them being dirty at all. I feel kind of stuck. AITA? Any suggestions on how I can go about this better?

Also since this came up last time I posted here: I'm autistic and posting here for genuine input rather than validation, so please don't be upset if anything seems obvious to you, because it isn't to me. (That's also why I can't clean bathrooms, if you're curious. SPD.) Obviously please do still be honest about my missteps though!

EDIT: Thank you very much for the input, everyone! And your patience too. My wife agrees this is obsessive behaviour on my part, partly a trauma response (I was abused as a child and constantly made to feel as if the cleanliness of a constantly-disgusting home was my personal responsibility) so I'm going to work on that. Started by taking a day off cleaning yesterday and while I was a bit bored not having those hours taken up, I got some other important things done, and more importantly the world miraculously did not end!

 I, 24 live with my mother and my younger sister in the same house. My sister is 19. My mother is 53, she is not that old but she is a cardiopath plus has an illness in her bones that make them weak so she usually needs help to shower etc... She is not completely dependant on others but almost. I have a job, from monday to friday, and I'm also seeing a psychologist because I have anxiety problems.

Living with my sister is being harder every day. Her moods dictate everything, if she is angry because reasons she wont leave her room and the problem is that she won't help with the house to-do's, she won't take HER dog out for a walk so he would end up shitting and peeing the whole house, she doesnt take the thrash out when its her turn so the bags just accumulate until an unnaceptable point and she would yell at my mother everytime she calls her for something that she needs her for.

I've tried several times to talk to her and my older sister 32 to see if she could reason with the younger and change something but it is useless.

Last thing was related to the trash, we had like 6 bags and she wasn't taking them out. I asked her, politely to take out the trash and she said ""I'll do it later"". I let it be. A few hours later I come back to her dorm and ask her for the trash, she responds again with ""I'll do it later"", I'm a little bit pissed off at this point and ask her: ""Later when? When your boyfriend comes so he can help you?"" to what she replies: ""he is not coming today"". I say, ""just take the trash out"". I later forgot about it and went to my pc. The next day I come to the kitchen and I see the trash it still there. I went to her dorm and I opened the door infuriated and I told her: ""weren't you supposed to take the trash out?"" and she just responds with: "" I just forgot about it"".  
It's not the first nor the second time that she ""forgots"" about it.

I decided to pick up my phone and take a picture of the disaster the trash bags were and I sent it to a group chat with were we 3 are and I said something like: ""this is just unnaceptable, I refuse to live like this"". My older sister is a kind person so she asks my younger to please take out the trash when she can.   
She's had time to do it, she just didn't want to.  
My younger responds: ""I can't lift the weight of all those bags my myself"" to what I say: ""that is YOUR problem, nobody asked you to let them stack"" and she left the group chat.

Last sesion I had with my psychologist I told him about this and he said, ""I think your sister needs a reality check and you should leave"". It took me by surprise because I've always thought that they are not supossed to give answers but to guide us to find them ourselves, but he was pretty clear and direct.

In the 2016, my brother met this Colombian girl online. He flew her here and got married soon as she hit US soil. He didn't know much about her but was desperate because he was in major accident in 2012 and it left him with several injuries. He still has scars and a limp so it affects his confidence. The girl is not affectionate towards him what so ever. I've never seen them hold hands or kiss or even really talk. They don't sleep in the same bed and she seems disgusted by his scars.

She travels back and forth to Colombia and was gone for several months. Well, fast forward to December 2019, I found out she was having a baby. I found it out because I saw a medical bill and thought it was mine and opened it. The baby is not my brother's Baby because the wreck made him unable to have children.  Now my brother is paying for all the medical bills for her and baby. My brother wants  our family to accept her and the baby, but I can't stand the way she treats him so I don't want nothing to do with them.

Also, My brother also has a Tramatic brain injury from the wreck. Most days he seems normal, but sometimes he doesn't seem like a rational adult and is impulsive. He can handle being an engineer but makes impulsive decisions without forethought, like, buying a Selby mustang just because he wanted it at that moment. He has run up several thousands of dollars on credit cards on that girl then filed bankruptcy in 2018.

This anxiety was caused because of me, when we were in a difficult situation for us both, putting my own anxiety and mental health over his. However this action meant that he developed severe anxiety.

Because his anxiety surrounds me however, it makes him very controlling. He expects me to avoid every single situation that makes him anxious, and he's just given me an ultimatum that if in the next 3 weeks i ""fuck up"" by doing something that makes him anxious, he'll break up with me. These ""fuck ups"" as he listed are: hanging out/talking to a friend of mine he doesn't like because she cheated on her boyfriend a year ago, wanting to join uni societies (he is anxious that it will lead to me finding someone else or getting caught up), anything involving alcohol, parties, social events in general that might give him anxiety, and being influenced or pressured by people. This includes hanging out with our friend group, as there is a few people in it he thinks want to break us up. Basically, anything involving alcohol, our friend group, my flatmates and a girl who is on my course counts as a ""fuck up"".

I have 100% given him reason not to trust me from that initial incident where I put myself first, but ever since that he's taken every tiny thing i do to make him anxious as a giant betrayal of his trust. For example - having coffee with my flatmates, wanting to go to group things etc. 

So basically, he doesn't trust me (for good reason), but i've been improving and doing everything he says for months but every tiny thing i do sets him off. I just have trouble understanding why certain stuff makes him anxious so I don't see why I should be the one to change - surely he should work towards improving his own anxiety, while I avoid situations that justifiably make him anxious, but not every single tiny thing, because it's starting to tire me out, having to constantly tell him what i'm doing and make every decision in my day around what he wants.

AITA here? Is he in the right, should I be avoiding every situation that makes him anxious - even if I feel it is unreasonable for him to be anxious over?

My little brother has basically adopted it, playing on it literally all day. And everything was going fine until my dad came in. He did not like that my bro was on it all day. So he told me that I had to sell the Xbox, I didn’t have a say in it at all. He didn’t care when just that it had to get out. And I had to sell EVERYTHING, this includes games, and accessories. Now last year my gf gave me Titanfall 2 on Xbox, however my dad made me sell that too. My gf found out was obliviously a little upset. A little later she said she was fine but I noticed she’s a bit cold towards me.

"eke4d9","1578236963","AITA for getting angry at my sister for stealing a PS4 game and then lying about it?"," I also got a PS4 game for Xmas.

I decided I wanted to open and play my PS4 games a few days ago. I couldn’t find them. I tuned the house Upside down and got yelled at by my family for not taking care of my stuff. 

My youngest sister went on holiday with her friend. She is a hopeless lier and often ruins things or takes things without permission (she has almost burnt the house down twice due to her escapades, one of the times she stole some batteries that were supposed to be put in the smoke detector and put them together,then left them on a stool. We do not have that stool anymore). 

I know it’s pathetic and a first world problem, but it’s due to this I cannot stand my youngest sister. 

We called her up after I thought I might have thrown it away by accident (I was desperate) and asked if she had it. She had it. I got angry because she took it without permission.

I asked if she opened it. She said no. I asked her to send a picture proving it and she did. I couldn’t see the plastic, but maybe that was just the light. So I believe her. I asked her not to open the game under any condition.

She came back today. She stole the game and opened it. I got angry. She lied, after taking my game. I asked her why she opened the game. She said she heard the disk rattling around, which I know wasn’t like that before. So either A) she was lying and opened the game to play it or B) it was thrown around and disrespected. 

I asked her if she played it. She said no, but she had that smirk on her face and that look in her eye that said she was lying (my dad and little sister are terrible at lying).

I yelled at her. I got yelled at by my parents for yelling at her. I am not just angry that she took it, but the fact that she lied.

After that I went up to my room and started crying. I’ve been having a tough time recently and nobody cares or understands and this is not how I want to spend my last day before I go back to school- which I detest. (Everyone there is an asshole- I hate it)

She came up to my room just to call me a grumpy bitch. As I was halfway through writing this, she came up to me again and sprayed a water gun at me.

I am so fed up. This is how every evening goes. She takes something then lies about it.

"ekekiq","1578239110","AITA For telling a disabled girl that no one cares about her disability?","I (16M) go to highschool. Since my first year of school, I have been in the same class as a girl who has a disability. This disability regulates her to a wheelchair, with this girl having this disability since the first grade.

However, this girl is also quite a bully. She constantly berates others and uses her disability as an excuse. When I was in the fifth grade, I had an issue with my weight and became quite anorexic. When I returned, she tormented me and told me ""I looked fat"" and other trigger words and phrases to intentionally hurt me. When I reported her to my teacher and eventually the principle, she said her disability makes her act like that sometimes. She did not apologise or anything. The principle and other teachers still decided to take her side.

Yesterday, I was in class and she started calling my best friend a loser and other hurtful names. My best friend is the sweetest guy I know and is also quite shy. I wasn't going to just stand there and let my best friend be harassed by this girl.

I told her to quit it and leave him alone. We got into an argument. When everyone saw what was going on, she got embarrassed and said her disability makes her act out sometimes (BTW, her disability has no mental aspects to it - she can control what she says). I then told her that no one cared about her disability and that being disabled didn't give her the right to act like a cunt and harass my best friend, who is like a brother to me.

According to her friends, I was way out of line. Apparently, the girl started crying because of the incident following class, and they wanted me and my best friend (who did not say anything btw) to apologise to her, or they would take it further. I have decided for the sake of my best friend that I would rather be suspended than apologize to her. I do not want him to think that she was in the right.

EDIT#1: I did end up getting suspended but it was honestly worth it. My best friend did not get into trouble thankfully though. My best friend ended up hugging me following me getting suspended and it made my year tbh. Considering how shy and stuff he is, a hug from him is like the highest honour.

EDITED

So I didn’t know a sub where I could ask; Am I wrong? That was very active. All I want to know is and I know this is childish but I feel like I’m making a good point. I’m a 17 year old guy that does online school and is planning on doing a trade school course during online school for welding. I do what I need to or am asked to do everyday, any chores, any requests, just about everything. In school I overachieve, even though it’s for the sole (&amp;lt; Is that the right spelling?) purpose of getting the hell out asap. Basically I’m ahead in school, I do all my stuff, and I’m not a bad kid but my mother insists that I can not use my Xbox for more than an hour a day. I feel that I should be able to, mainly for the reason that I don’t see friends often anymore because I do school online so I play R6 with them which if you didn’t know it’s impossible to only play an hour of R6 and enjoy it. Anyways, I might sound ridiculous but I don’t feel ridiculous, please don’t be a dick in the comments. Thanks!


EDIT: Ok, so I guess I’ll have to go into a lot more detail because there’s a lot more at play here than just “ no you can’t play the Xbox”. 
Thing is, I grew up with two brothers pretty poor and I was not always a good kid I was DEFINITELY an asshole earlier but there was a lot of factors in play there too. We didn’t have money before in part from my father not being around but also from some very un-adult like decisions my mother made and we’ve always had a rocky relationship. I wanted to get around saying this because I know it sounds like what any teen would say but I know my Mom and she doesn’t dance around things, if she has a reason she tells me but this time all I hear is “ just because” I know that it’s mostly just because she doesn’t like me playing video games, she thinks that playing video games= being lazy. The crazy part is that if I’m not playing games then I’m my free time I’m watching netflix or YouTube and she has no problem with that.","1578955267.0","Not the A-hole","3","20"

I (18F) and dating “Jake” (15M), he’s a sophomore in high school and I am a freshman in college. He’s great and we’re really happy together, but recently there’s been a few issues. 

Basically, there is this girl that he is friends with, “Rachel.” She has known Jake since 6th grade, as they are in the same grade, and they’re pretty close friends. But about a month ago I started hearing her make comments that I was just not okay with. 

It started with her telling Jake that he had a nice butt, which she defended by saying she was listing multiple boys, so she didn’t just say that he had a nice butt. She also told him that she had a crush on him at the beginning of the year, but she found out that he has a girlfriend and then she stopped. 

I dmed her on Instagram and told her she was making me uncomfortable with her comments, and she apologized and said that she’d be more mindful of what she said. I was still upset but Jake told me to drop it because Rachel just wanted it to be done with, so I did. 

But then a week later I went to one of their gigs (they are both in a singing group at their school), and Rachel was talking to Jake and another one of the members of the group. 

Both Jake and the other boy sing bass, and Rachel said “The basses sounded hot today.” I just kind of had it. I dmed her again that night and basically told her that she needed to back off. She then responded and called me insecure, Jake told me to just leave her alone. 

This all happened about a month ago, and since then whenever I bring it up both Jake and his friend “Mark,” who also is friends with Rachel, both tell me that thats just how she talks to everyone. I don’t understand why everyone is defending her. 

I was texting Mark about her the other day, and it ended with him telling her about it and her dming me. I sent what she said to me to both Jake and Mark, but they both told me she was right. They both think I’m in the wrong here.

So yesterday the landlord called the plumber(P) over because of a small leak in the bathroom. ive met the guy before, as he was over for a leak a year ago. He's a guy in his late 50s, grey hair grey mustache, short but stocky. He comes in wearing a denim shirt with jeans. Hes friendly (for now) and I point him to the bathroom and he gets to work. I go upstairs to my room to play some COD.

I get a call from my roommate 20 minutes later saying the plumber wants to talk to me. I think, ok the job must be done and I go downstairs. hes standing in the doorway outside with the door open. I come down and say, ""hey howd it go?"" and he just looks at me.. stares.. for 30 seconds in anger. He lets me know the progress on the bathroom and says he'll be over soon to complete the job once he gets the right parts.  I take out my hand for a handshake and say, ""thanks see you soon"" and he again just looks at me.. and then YELLS

""THERE BETTER NOT BE NO FUCKING DOPE SMOKING NEXT TIME I COME HERE!!!""

I stood there utterly in shock, because this was so fucking random.. and sort of just stare back at him and say... "" ahh ok"". Close the door and just stand there. Now for some background info, my entire house smokes, I do it weekly, but everyone else does it almost daily... Now that shouldnt fucking matter, because who the fuck is he to say anything about my house or ME in my home and to say it so loudly to scream at me?!

Enter my gf of 2 years - she's a uni grad with a good job, but still lives at home with her parents. As clued on as she is about her professional field I'm not exagerrating when I say she doesn't even know how to basic shit like post a fucking letter.

Whenever she's asked for help with something, what she really is asking for is for someone to take responsibility for the task. A couple of examples from the last few months:

(1) she bought her first car (an absolute shit heap, bit it is a first car) and asked me to look it over after wards. So I tried to show her some basic maintenance things she can do on her own drive; how to check the tyre pressure, the oil, headlights, explaining fuel reserves etc etc. She showed no interest, and come a couple months later the thing had clonked out....I went out to have a look and there was no oil in the fucking thing.

(2) we booked a holiday for 2 weeks to tour South East Asia. I asked her if her passport had at least a year on it. She said yes. At the airport she found out it was expired after I had a look at it. I asked why she hadn't checked to renew it: her dad was the one who had sent the application in 10 years ago and she didn't know it had to be sent in to be renewed (wtf?).

This second one is what caused her to blow up at me, I returned from the holiday (she didn't answer any of my calls or text whilst I was abroad) and once I was back she chewed me out for abandoning her at the airport (its a 20 min train ride from our city center and the terminus is at the airport), that I should have double checked her documentation since I know about this sort of stuff. I told her, sorry, but I ain't pissing 3000 pounds up the wall because you didn't bother to check the exact thing I asked you to.

I have two children with Chris both are 10months.

I love each of my children *but* I do everything with no help, the last time I went out was 5 years ago.

Emma is going through her teen phase right now too and I'm putting up with everything, Chris is doing literally nothing, I don't even think I've seen him hold one of his children this week (*He doesn't pay them much attention because he doesn't think they have a personality right now*) 

***Before anyone says***  marriage counselling  ***etc, we're doing it all, and I'm not here for relationship advice so let's stick to the Q***

I decided to book 3 days in a hotel, the youngest children are at my mothers.

According to my sister I'm an ""asshole"" for putting myself first and taking a break on Emma's week because she's going to blame herself for it, apparently this was just ""*plain selfish*""

Lots of emotions as you would imagine but mostly wanting to get it over with cause I’ve been planning this wedding basically all by myself for almost a year now.  Anyways, J moved to another state for professional school last June where he will stay for the next 3.5 years. I plan to move in with him in late March after the honeymoon. 

So a little bit about me, I’m an amateur self-taught baker. Had a short stint with selling my creations but now it’s mostly for fun and family events. I was also laid off from my FT job right before Thanksgiving (awesome I know) and have just been planning the wedding, applying to jobs in J’s state, and preparing for the move since. 

I recently found out one of my idol bakers,  Amaury Guichon (seriously go watch some of his videos if you aren’t familiar) hosts a 10 week long course in Vegas for about 1.5k. Includes course reference material and a tool set all for keeps. Luckily for me it’s only 4 hrs from J so it wouldn’t be costly to get there and I could potentially come home on the weekends. The only thing I’m sort of hung up on is finding an affordable place to stay during the week. J isn’t on board with the idea of me leaving family (aka him) for a hobby for that long nor does he think the price tag is worth it. He compared it to getting a degree in basket weaving or philosophy (no offense if you have either...he’s just a very pragmatic guy). 

My arguments are 1) it’s a temporary leave and short compared to his 2) I have the flexibility atm since I’m still jobless 3) it could potentially be lucrative 4) it’s a hobby, I shouldn’t have to justify it? 5) his hobbies include gaming which he has a desktop for albeit he didn’t build it just for gaming and he bought himself a fairly nice piano that he doesn’t play regularly. But I should add he purchased both before we started dating. 6) I would be paying for this course and my lodging myself. We don’t have any joint accounts yet 7) I deserve something for myself after planning the bulk of the wedding

She hasn't bought the tickets yet and the trip is gonna be for the end of March.

The trip is gonna consist of drinking and doing 'touristy' things so money is also a worry for me as I'm currently on disability and although my boyfriend works, we're not really leftover with a lot of money after bills are paid.
My mum is aware that I'm skint but isn't really answering about how much things are gonna cost so that's also driving up the anxiety and I've been trying to save up some money for the trip but it's had to be spent on an unexpected bill and a broken fridge so I'm back to being skint again.

They started off as a drunken hookup every so often in between other relationships. Several years after college they started casually dating. She caught him with another girl and gave him an ultimatum and that’s how they became exclusive. They ended up buying a house together when their mutual friend and roommate moved out. Every single step they take has been because of circumstance, not by choice.
From there on out it was always her trying to keep him in this relationship and he was apathetic toward the whole thing. He sits on the couch and drinks all day and ignores her. Fast forward to last year and they got pregnant by accident. She decided to keep the baby, he didn’t want to, but here they all are, a family of three. He blames her for “trapping him” and was openly hostile towards her throughout the entire pregnancy. The baby is now 4 months old and not only is my friend suffering from PPD, she is getting no emotional support from this man. Never has.
She has panic attacks about having to face him and the future of their relationship but she keeps holding on, and IMO she needs to just let go of this slug.

All of my in-laws double check with me before loaning my bf money because he has been known to borrow money just to buy weed. 
I told BIL “we’re doing fine we have groceries, a full tank of gas and I get paid on Friday. I don’t even know why he’s asking you for it.” 
Right after I said that my BIL responds with “oh ok well I have to go talk to someone so I’ll talk to you later”  bf comes up and starts talking in the background, so I look at him and motion *☝🏼* (raising my index finger as if I were asking for a minute) asking that he be quiet and wait a second.

Infidelity is a touchy subject in this house...","(Correction to clarify - The school the kids are in is center school not middle school. My town uses it to mean the years immediately before middle school. Confusing way to name it!) 

I am 20 and I have a stepbrother Ethan who is 8. He has a ""girlfriend"" Cindy if you can call their relationship that; they're so young and dating to them just means hanging out at recess and writing cute notes in school.

My dad married Ethan's mom. The two of them are really busy and have me babysit Ethan often. I swear I've probably done more raising of this kid than anyone recently.

Anyway he told me that he has a second girlfriend now. I asked him what her name is and how they met. He said Jess, he met her at after school activities. I asked what Cindy thinks of her. He said he didn't tell her. 

I asked how he thinks the girls would feel if they knew he has two girlfriends, and he seemed to dodge the question. 

I talked to him about how you need to be honest in your relationships or it will make people very sad and betrayed feeling when the dishonesty comes out. 

This is a topic I feel strongly about. My dad cheated on my mom with Ethan's mom. My own mom is no longer with us. It was a really difficult time in my life, it still hurts, and it's important to me that I have more integrity and expect more integrity in my relationships and friends. I want to bring my stepbrother up with honesty and integrity too.

So Ethan actually talked to both of the girls. First, Jess. She told him she didn't really want a boyfriend anyway, she just wanted to play and forget it. Then he talked to Cindy and they apparently made up, and she wanted to keep being his girlfriend and best friend if he could promise they'd be each other's best friends no matter what.

We had a long talk after this, I asked how he was feeling, he said he was feeling happy that he'd been honest. He was feeling really guilty after our first talk, he didn't like how it felt to be lying even though it had seemed fun at first. 

I told him about how proud I was of him, how he was learning to do difficult stuff and be a good honest kind man, something that some people do not learn until they are much older. Some people never learn how to at all. And he'd done a very grown up, difficult,and kind thing. 

I thought all was well. Then a few weeks passed and suddenly Ethan's mom was furious at me. She had found out about what I'd asked Ethan to do, and I'd overstepped. I'm a babysitter, and I was trying to discipline him and teach him like a parent? 

I lost my temper at her and said that I'd been being the closest thing to a parent that he had for a year. And that the lesson I was trying to teach is something every child ought to learn before they grow up, lest they engage in infidelity and tear a family apart.

She said that I was not welcome in her home if I spoke to her like that...

Now, I've never given my parents a reason not to trust me, I've got a 4.0 and never miss a class, but my mother still likes to track my location on a whim, which is frustrating because it makes me feel like she doesn't trust me. Also, she does this to the point where she can tell when I wake up based on my online activity on Instagram and Snapchat.

I've also recently found out that my parents have the ability to go through and read all of our texts since we have a Verizon family plan, this isn't a problem for me since I use discord, but it has led to some conflicts between my parents and my sister (18 f, my twin). They never even told my sister why they were mad at her.

My mom has had serious issues with us leaving the house and guilt trips us if we want to stay on campus for the weekend, but yells at us because we aren't really involved in any clubs (most of which meet at night on Friday which is when she makes us drive home)

I don't want to cause any more problems at home, but it's gotten to the point where she called me this morning to yell at me for not going to the gym and working out.

I stay with him, advocate for him when the doctors just want to send him home, and finally they do actual tests to figure out what's wrong.

 Now we were a bit bored so I suggested we play scrabble. This head of branch didn't know how to play so I explained the rules to him.



So anyway we're all having a good time laughing with each other everything's cool until a few turns after I put a 'controversial' word. The word essentialy translated to 'shit faced' (from Hebrew התחרבנו) but the direct translation would be (they/we) got shitted out. Everyone was fine with the word but then after about 2 or 3 turns, the head of branch noticed it and claimed that it wasn't allowed due to being slang. I said that the word existed and the slang was just a different meaning given to it. 



Anyway we checked online and apparently it is a word with the same letters but a slightly different pronunciation and a completely different meaning that meant ""got destroyed"".

Now I want to note this was 2-3 of my turns later, you couldn't just go back it would change the whole game and not to mention it was totally legal. 



Anyway he said he was the Head of branch so he could throw all the pieces on the floor and force us to tidy it up. So he did, not willing to debate, anyway I was pissed.

"evabsr","1580240264","AITA for kicking my son out and cutting him off for his attitude towards my daughter","I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

My ex and I married when my (step)son was 4. His biological mother had passed away. My ex quickly turned into a deadbeat, but I stayed for his son. I felt horrible that his dad was so uninvolved and I didn’t want him to be abandoned by 3 parental figures. My ex gave me legal guardianship over my stepson but would not let me adopt him. We stayed together until my ex up and left when my son was 16. He emptied all the accounts, including my son’s 529 account, and just left.

I spent the next two years trying to get back on my feet and trying to put money together for my son. I ended up getting about $20k for his education, but that wasn’t nearly what we’d promised him before my ex left.

My son was in therapy through all this and we also did family therapy on and off. He did not want me as a mother and rejected me. He wanted his father, but his father was unavailable. It was terrible and sad, and my son grew up angry. I can’t blame him for that.

My son is now 25. He is mostly financially independent aside from me occasionally helping out here and there.

Last year, my close friend passed away and left a 5 year old daughter. I adopted her, which we had planned together before her passing. That has also been a difficult transition. 

My son was visiting and asked me if I was putting money away for my adopted daughter. I told him I was saving for her college and he exploded. This isn’t the first time he’s yelled, and I’ve told him not to disrespect me in my own home, but this was the first time he did it in front of my daughter. He told me it was my fault my ex left and took his money and I owed it to him to give him money before I gave it to “some girl.” I told him to get out and not to come back.

I’m done at this point. I’ve tried so hard to be there for him, but now I have to think about my daughter as well, and the last thing she needs is someone undermining her position in my life. Am I the asshole for kicking him out and cutting him off?","False","Not the A-hole","38","446"

For more context, i work and go to school full time. I had no problem with that because that particular day I didn’t have any classes until 1 so I took them no problem. She called me two days ago and told me to pick them up from the airport tomorrow at 4am again, but I work a full day of work on a Wednesdays, this Wednesday I have a meeting with my boss’s boss and the night before I have a night class until 8:45 pm. I told her this wouldn’t work but she was more than welcome to come over and sleep here since her car is here, so she wouldn’t have to drive home super early. I told her to get an Uber because it was only about $30. She completely brushed me off and then called me today and pretty much asked what time I’ll be there tomorrow morning. I told her again that this could not work for me and she started acting like I was such an asshole and she pulled the ‘but we’re family’ card. She was like ‘well we were in Cali all week and spent money.’ I even offered to pay for their Uber and they accepted that, which threw me off because I was just trying to be nice.

"evacpe","1580240373","AITA for leading the prayer in class despite being openly atheist?","I am 25F, grad student. For this story, it is important to disclose that my country is predominantly Roman Catholic, the grad school I currently attend is Catholic, but I am openly atheist and have been one since I was 11 years old. 

Earlier today was my first meeting for this subject, the heaviest major units wise for the semester. My professor (70M, religious, is known to have opening and closing prayer every period) made eye contact with me and asked me to lead the opening prayer. Despite being an atheist, I led the prayer and said a safe Our Father (I memorize the prayers because I studied in Catholic schools and my family is Catholic)

The reason why I did this was because I didn’t want to risk a possible negative reaction, interrogation, or debate with my professor which could ruin his impression of the class. You know how some old religious people view atheism as subversive and wrong especially in a predominantly Catholic country like mine. I wasn’t forced to lead the prayer, but I just sucked it up and did it anyway since I felt that reciting an opening prayer for one minute outweighed the possible consequences to the class if my professor reacted negatively to me declining to lead the prayer due to my atheism.

A few hours after, one of my classmates calls me out and says that they felt offended at what I did because I knowingly disrespected the Catholic faith by reducing solemn and holy prayers into a meaningless vocalization. They say that prayers should always be said with meaning and that I shouldn’t have led the prayer when I am not a spiritual person ans don’t even believe in God. They say that only Catholics should lead the prayer as a respect for the faith.

I explained to them why I did what I did (same explanation as above), that I was put on the spot, but they still insist I’m in the wrong and that I still shouldn’t have led the prayer since I’m an atheist.

I shared this story with my friends and have garnered mixed feedback. AITA?

TLDR: Prof asks me to lead the opening prayer, I’m atheist but lead the prayer anyway since I didn’t want to risk having the prof negatively react if I declined. Classmate called me out and said that I disrespected their faith by doing that. AITA?","False","Not the A-hole","8","57"
"evaeco","1580240551","AITA for ""confronting"" my coworkers when my performance review turned up that I was ""bossy?""","At my old job we were a small team of three, one of which was the lead. Admittedly, our lead had no prior leadership experience and was fairly passive, so the three of us tended to just so our own thing while coordinating with each other. I was frequently looking at metrics and sending periodic updates to my coworkers (job involved us being on the move in the building simultaneously) and while I never bossed anyone around per se, I can see how what I thought were helpful things could come across as bossy. No one indicated any issues to me and we all at face value worked well as a team.     

Come closer to christmas we had plans to hire more seasonal employees for our team. At this point we still worked well and my manager frequently spoke my praises and talked about promoting me so as far as I was aware there were no problems. Despite talks of my being promoted, the other non-lead in our original three was promoted instead. Shortly before that my manager gave me a performance review where nothing about my skill in the workplace was discussed, just that I wasn't friendly, people didn't like me, and that I was too bossy. Boss couldn't give me any examples, and instead doubled-down on my unlikeability and lack of friendliness being a problem.    

I didn't know where I went wrong though I wasn't in utter disbelief that anyone could have said I was bossy. I went to the other two core members and a new hire with one-on-one talks that more-or-less went ""Hey I had my performance review and boss says people have complained I'm bossy. I'm sorry if I've ever been that way with you, please don't hesitate to let me know if I act out of line in the future - this is something I need to work on."" I gathered from conversational context the new hire had made the complaint but I did nothing with that information. The conversations all ended amicably, and in fact I felt better having opened up the pathway to conversations about the issue.  

Later on in the week on a phone-call with my boss she was upset about other things and brought up the ""bossy"" issue. Long story short what got back to her is that I interrogated everyone so that I could find out who ""told on me"" and that I made everything worse. She berated me for a solid 20 minutes and again brought up my personal traits she didnt like. I ended up not coming back to work the next day for several reasons, but largely because I felt my boss was being outright MEAN rather than professional, partially out of embarassment by the situation, and because I didn't want to be part of a workplace that prides ""tattling"" over having adult conversations.    

I don't regret leaving that job, but I still wonder if I was in the wrong for talking to my coworkers. AITA?  
   
   
   
Edit: Because I feel some context is missing. The ""bossy"" things I did were things my boss encouraged and promoted in *me* specifically. Leading up to my performance review she would frequently bad-mouth the leadership skills of our official lead, praise me, talk about me replacing her, and having me pick up her duties. I didn't assume them for myself or anything. 
   
   
Edit2: To be clear, I did ask my boss for examples and elaboration during my performance review. She didn't give me examples and only referred back to her saying I was bossy as the example...and got angry as I kept pressing for any more information. I also think she had concerns about maybe giving away who complained about me, so that probably didnt make it easy for her in her defense.

I'll admit that I'm being judgemental when speaking about this, but there's only so much understanding I can muster after 5 marriages and 4 divorces. The worst part being that it's a pattern at this point, I can already see the 5th divorce and maybe, even the 6th marriage. 

His first marriage was when he was 21. We were all excited albeit skeptical because he knew his girlfriend for 1 year. Still, we decided to go along with it. 2 years later came the divorce, my brother just said it wasn't working out and didn't offer much of an explanation. A year later after this, he was getting married again. 2nd marriage lasted only a year and ended with the same explanation. 

The longest marriage was the 3rd, that lasted for 4 years. The 4th ended after 2 years.

We have tried to figure out what is the reason behind this but we came up with nothing. Talking to him doesn't work because he always gives vague answers. Talking to his ex-wives doesn't work either because they don't even know what happened either. He's doing well in his job, got promoted a few times in the last few years, has a good social life... Literally everything else besides his love life is good.

When I got the news of this new marriage I sent my congratulations and my brother asked me to be one of the bridesmaids which is a role I played in the previous marriages. I told him I would think about it but the truth is that I don't even want to go to this wedding. Our parents don't seem thrilled about the whole thing either but they have told me to do it, and I know my other brother will be a groomsman again.

Sarah and her buddies were a lot better at skating then I was, since they could afford lessons and I couldn't at the time. I always felt inferior to them, and the way they treated me didn't make me feel any better. 

They wouldn't let me practice around them. They were doing all this cool stuff, but I was a noob then and was still learning. They actively pushed me away from them to go and practice alone in a corner. It hurt a lot, but I never understood why. We all started as beginners, so why are they treating me this way? (Keep in mind i've had a lot of issues with 'friends' like this and have always been treated like a outcast, even though I tried to be nice to everybody) 

Sarah eventually broke her ankle, which made it difficult for her to continue skating. Still, I would go with her and her two friends whenever they went (they actually always invited me).

One day though, while I was sadly skating alone again in the corner, I noticed Sarah had an uncomfortable look on her face, and she was whispering among her friends, and I figured her ankle was bothering her. So, trying to be sympathetic I went over and asked if she was ok. All I got in return was a disgusted look as she skated away and off the ice. I asked one of her friends if her ankle was causing her trouble, to which I got an awkward smile and no response and both her friends shortly followed her.

Leaving me alone with my thoughts, I came to the decision that they were fake assholes and they were trying to avoid me, so when I saw they were leaving and one of the girls was waving through the glass to me, I just flipped her off and turned my back. Later, I sent a lot of angry messages to Sarah, accusing her of being a b\*tch and how abandoned I felt, like they weren't actually my friends. 

One of her friends started blowing up my phone with calls I never answered, and the other one messaged me saying they were sorry but Sarah was in a lot of pain and they needed to leave, to which I pointed out that I had asked and never got a response.

He recently volunteered to be deployed with a different boat, and gave me basically three weeks notice that he would leave. He has been gone for about three weeks.

(With Y11 exams coming up, everyone's under quite a lot of pressure, and the topic of revision took up most of the conversation.) We got around to talking about annoying things other people do that add to this prominent amount of stress, when I brought up the topic of a year 12 girl (who I didn't name) that I had met just 4 months ago, and had learnt the name of three months ago. 

Now, since I got her number a few weeks ago, she has texted me uncomfortably frequently. It started off okay, she would text me every now and then with 'how are you?', 'what's up?' and you get the idea, and then got more frequent, and I (with severe clinical anxiety and social anxiety) didn't really know how to end a conversation, or tell her not to text me as much without sounding like a complete asshole. A couple of weeks ago, when I was watching a movie with one of my friends, I put my phone on silent (as is polite in a cinema) and left it on silent while I ate lunch with aforementioned friend (as is polite when you're talking with and/or eating with company.) I come home and check my phone to find 11 messages, all from the same girl, completely freaking out and frantically panicking because I was offline for two and a half hours. She began apologising for 'pissing me off,' so, as soon as I saw this, I responded telling her I wasn't mad, followed by a whole conversation of her saying that she was sorry for this and that, and me reassuring her that she did nothing wrong. 

Remember I don't know this girl very well AT ALL; she begins to text me every day after this, and I find this really uncomfortable, so I ignore the majority of these messages. And then, she came to me during my study period and asked me basically the same thing: 'was I mad at her?' 'am I ignoring her?' etc. etc. - this took twenty minutes. I didn't get to study for that twenty minutes, and I had a mock the next day. So, it's been like this every day; she texts me a lot, apologises a lot, tends to complain to me a lot, and I've been suffering under the weight of her problems AND mine. I have no problem being the comfort figure, but not every day, and not to someone I barely know.

But, when I bring this up with my friends, one of them looks at me, then says that I'm dismissing someone else's anxieties/ their problems and that I should try and see their side of things. as I'm walking to the next study period, I hear her say to another of my friends behind me, ""I hate people who talk shit about other people's anxieties""

On mobile, first time poster etc! Title sounds awful but hear me out. Happened last year but I still think about this now so I’m interested in people’s opinions.

Myself (F21) and N (F19) used to work together. For about a year we were quite close. When she went thought a breakup I spent a lot of time listening to her vent and writing comforting responses. It was all she spoke about for months. She has used breakups, illnesses and even other people’s grief to make things about her and get attention in the past (often by crying publicly and making a scene). 

At the end of 2018 I went through an awful breakup. N was getting into a new relationship at the time and although I was happy for her, it was all she could talk about. She’s always been a self-centred person but this was too much. Eventually I started distancing myself slightly from her because she was making me feel worse. If I tried to talk about my problems she would bring the conversation back to her as soon as she could. 

Fastforward to March 2019. We were still friends but less close. I was hospitalised for a few days. I posted online that I was in hospital.  During that time a lot of people messaged me to ask how I was and to say they hoped I was doing better. N and one other person were the only friends who didn’t say anything to me. The next time I saw them at a group outing they pretended as if nothing had happened at all. 

After this I distanced myself even further from N as I just felt she was only interested in talking to me if she could talk about herself. One evening I was feeling very sick - I picked up my phone to cancel on my friends and then went to lie down. When I looked at my phone again N had sent multiple messages accusing me of ignoring her bc I’d been online without reading and responding to her messages. I explained that I was ill and she apologised. 

A few weeks later the same thing happens, except this time I’m not sick I’m just not opening her messages as quickly as I used to. When I check my phone the next morning she’s messaged me on multiple social medias saying I’m ignoring her again.  I reply saying that’s not my intention and whilst I’m sorry that she’s going through a difficult time, I am as well and I don’t have the emotional strength to be there for her all the time. She told me her dad had been diagnosed with cancer. I expressed how sorry I was to hear that but made it clear my original message still stood. She seemed to understand at the time but then it happened again. 

After this, I made a clear point of distancing myself from her. I felt she’d been a shit friend to me, violated my boundaries even after I explained I needed space and, like with her breakup, was purposefully being attention-seeking.

Basically, my roommate is one of the most irresponsible people I’ve ever met. He’s 23-years-old, and he doesn’t know how to clean up after himself. He leave dirty dishes strewn throughout the apartment (and never washes his dishes). He has never cleaned anything even once. He never washes his dog and lets him lie down on blankets and pillows he keeps on the couch. The smell and disarray of our apartment is so bad that I spend most of my time out of the house or in my bedroom because I can’t stand it. 

On multiple occasions, my other roommates and I have had roommate meetings where we try to lay out some ground rules about cleaning expectations we all have. For the sake of this post, I’ll call the messy roommate Jay. During the meetings, we do not attack Jay or air our grievances. We just say, “I think we should all wash our dishes every day, and we should take turns cleaning the apartment each week.” Each meeting, Jay ends up blowing up at us and insulting us. Last time, he said he “wasn’t a problem,” and we needed to stop “blaming him for the state of the apartment.” Keep in mind, we never blamed him in the meeting; everyone just voiced their cleaning expectations, and I’m guessing he got defensive because all of them were things he doesn’t do. 

Anyway, after the last meeting, he finally agreed to a cleaning schedule, and he agreed to start washing the blankets and pillows on the couch each week since his dog makes them smell. However, he’s just gotten worse, and today, the apartment was so bad that I decided to clean up his messes for my own peace of mind. I did a ton of dishes (all of which were his because everyone else does their own), and I put his blankets and pillows in the washer. 

One of his pillows ended up busting open in the wash, and because I was already annoyed with the situation, I just took it outside to the dumpster without telling him. In retrospect, I realize it wasn’t my property and I shouldn’t have done that. And I’m also wondering if I shouldn’t have washed his stuff in the first place, even though he keeps it in a communal area.

I specifically ask members to please not bring in their kids. Not only for safety concerns but because for most people this is their ""me"" time.

My club does not have any sort of daycare at all. Even the lounge area is around a corner where you wouldn't be able to see it while working out on 90% of the equipment. Before I started getting more strict on children, parents would seat their kids in the lounge, put on their headphones, and leave their child unsupervised for over an hour. I have a giant window in my office that allows me to be able to see into that sitting area and so for over an hour I am constantly running out my office to try to stop a kid from pushing one of our emergency buttons. 9/10 there would be broken toys, crumbs, drink spills, or sticky finger prints everywhere when they finally leave.

What ended up pushing me to the point of hardly allowing children at all was watching a kid running through the club and running under someone who was struggling to hold up an overhead press. After that I put signs up all over the gym about no children.

Now, what happens when I leave at night to go home is another story. Despite the entire club being covered in cameras and every members key being logged when they enter the club, people think that there would be no way for me to know what is happening at night. I had a member come to me with a video that she had taken on her phone of a small kid that was **swinging** from one of the machines and **screaming** as loud as he could. I didn't have time to go back through the cameras that day, but the next day several other members came to me about the same problem with pictures and videos on their phones. I found out who the girl was and deactivated her key right then. Without a notice or a warning. The next day I went through cameras from around the time she would have come in and saw as she and her son stood there confused and struggling to open the door.

After watching her and her kid standing in the cold for a few minutes trying to open the door I started to feel a bit like TA...so AITA?

"evbcv5","1580244527","AITA for not wanting to do four dishes?","So for the past couple of months, two friends of mine that are dating have been my roommates. When they first moved in, we all sort of had our own jobs around the house. L would do the dishes, J would sweep and clean the kitchen counters/table, and I would take out the garbage and recycling as well as clean the bathroom and because I have a cat I would obviously clean up after her too.

Fast forward a month or two, L and J feel like I'm not doing enough, so I started doing my own dishes in order to remove some of the workload for L. L thanked me and so did J because J tends to look out for L since she gets too anxious to say things sometimes.

Now, we're in the present. L and J one night went over to their friends and didn't come back, didn't really phase me and I got bored so I washed all of the dishes, save for 4 of them because due to being autistic, some things send me into sensory overload and I am physically incapable of doing them. These dishes include a pot that has old spaghetti sauce in it, two plates, and a cheese grater.

L and J havent been home in like a week now, and L just came home quickly to grab her work uniform, so I said ""Hey, whenever you get the chance can you do those 4 dishes? I can't"" and she said sure no problem and then left.

Five minutes later, I get a text from J asking: ""Can you just do the dishes, or do I have to come back and do them. We do them every time I dont know why its a big deal to do them once but if I need to come back I will"" to which I explained why I couldn't, and then I asked what he meant by they 'do them every time' because I've been cleaning my own dishes

When I said this, he referred to the months way way before when we all had our own jobs around the house and then said ""We took care of your cat for 3 days a few months back, it's just some dishes"" which I replied to with ""yes you did do them for months, and then you said I wasnt doing anything, so I stepped up and started cleaning up after myself. I once again didnt say it needed to be done right now or anything I just meant whenever you get back could you do those 4 dishes thats all. also you didnt have to take care of my cat, you could have just said no if I knew it wasnt just a favor and something I had to pay back I wouldnt have asked.""

I also explained that it felt as though everything I had started doing was useless and going unnoticed, to which J responded freaking out about the house rules (The landlord's rules, like no smoking in the house and since they pay the hydro, no showers or laundry before 7 pm) which stressed me out more because every time I explained myself it felt like J just had a new thing to attack me for. This went on for a bit just him accusing and me explaining. 

Finally I said ""Alright, from now on, I clean up after me, you clean up after you. The way roommates are supposed to"" and he said that just leads to fights, so I said it only leads to fights if you only think emotionally and not rationally. Now, he has yet to respond and I'm so frustrated, am I the asshole?","False","Not the A-hole","5","7"

In his defense, I know that he's highly uncomfortable with the subject of childhood in general, so perhaps I shouldn't have said anything.

It’s fine, I don’t mind cooking some of the time or just making a sandwich, but I don’t get out of work until 7 so it was nice to come home to dinner.

Sometimes I’ll come home and she’s cooking something - but not for me. Last night I got home and she was making scrambled eggs. I asked her in the future if she could make me some when she makes it for herself and she said no. She said I could make eggs myself. 

I know I can make eggs myself, but adding a few extra eggs to a pan of scrambled eggs only requires about 10% extra effort where having a separate person make a whole other batch takes twice the effort. I articulated this to her and she said she didn’t care and I can make it myself. 

I told her that’s a terrible attitude but if she wants to make my life harder for no reason she can. She yelled at me and said that I’m making my life harder not her. That doesn’t really make any sense.

Keep in mind whenever I make something I intend to eat myself I always ask if she’s eaten and if she wants anything. On weekends I cook for both of us but it’s not really feasible to make anything decent on weekdays.

"evbut7","1580246543","AITA for not wanting my toddler around my in-laws?","THROW AWAY ACCOUNT. Background: my husband (26) and I (25) have been together for almost eight years (married for 4) and his parents have never liked me. His mom would try to convince him to date other girls, say snide things to me about my weight, make fun of me for not liking to be touched, disregarding things I have said, etc. while his dad straight up refused to acknowledge my existence to the point refusing to speak to me or even look at me. I know they spoke poorly of me to the rest of his family or didn't mention me at all because on my wedding day (which they refused to speak to me at), I had a distant aunt ask who I was because MIL told her he was marrying his ex-girlfriend. I'm not quite sure why they've never liked me, but I always assumed it was because they preferred this ex instead of me.

&#x200B;

About a year after the wedding, we announced that I was pregnant (intentionally) and suddenly it switched from FIL never acknowledging me, to only acknowledging the baby and MIL becoming WAY too involved.

&#x200B;

It has only gotten worse since I've given birth. Any time they have watched our son, he has come home with severe diaper rash, hasn't been fed all day, hasn't slept the entire time he was there, or was wrapped in a cat pee-soaked blanket. I understand that they are not his parents and should not be required to take care of our child, but these events occurred after they specifically asked to watch him. There have even been incidents of my FIL feeding him foods that he is allergic to, and when I told him to stop he told my son ""oh no, mom caught us, mom's the bad guy. Can't have fun with her around."" Unfortunately, it seems that every time my son is at their house, something like this happens and my toddler suffers because of it. It is to the point where he is not allowed to be at their house unsupervised for his safety.

&#x200B;

My husband feels like he is stuck in the middle of this because his parents refuse to listen to my concerns and they refuse to speak to me. My only concern is for my child's health and well-being. I've told him that if he was being treated this way at a daycare, we would remove him immediately, so why is it okay for him to be treated this way at his grandparents' house? My husband is struggling because he feels like he can't turn his back on his family and he wants his son to know his grandparents, but he is worried about what could happen to him if he is left alone.

&#x200B;

To clarify, any time they want to see our son, my husband makes sure they have time together, but that it is supervised, they are never refused visits, but they always seem to try to push him out of the house so they can be alone with my son. I don't necessarily think they are intentionally abusive, I think it is more just negligence or just ignorance?

&#x200B;

I worry I may be the asshole for keeping my son from his grandparents, but I’m conflicted.

"evbyg8","1580246927","AITA for finally poking back at my childfree sister-in-law?","My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""

Anyway: she's really mad at me now.  AITA?

**EDIT:** OK, despite the top comment, there were enough ESH judgments in here that I went ahead and called her to apologize for being a dick.  She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.

I'm a very social person, and my job is usually hit-and-miss with how much social interaction I get on a daily basis. I'm more savvy with paperwork between us, and have been doing all the work with our realtor, bank, etc. On top of this, I'm also taking online classes for my position at work, and it's all been piling up. I get home exhausted, mentally drained, and all I want to do is relax and play games after I cook us dinner. (Side note, I don't consider dinner being a chore because I enjoy cooking, and it does help me relax having made a satisfying meal.)

My boyfriend has been getting annoyed that we aren't spending any time together, and has expressed that we haven't been doing anything meaningful with each other. (By meaningful, I also mean being intimate, which we've been few and far between in the past month.) I apologize, and say I'm just tired all the time. There's a lot going on. Of course this always leads to him going on about how annoyed he is with ""I'm tired"" excuses, because ""He's tired too."" I won't deny that he's tired on a different level than I am-- he works on his feet and does a lot of physical labor, and I couldn't even handle that myself. The way he says it still gets under my skin, regardless.

All I want, for once, is to come home to a nice, big hug, a smooch on the cheek, and for someone to ask me about my day. He's the opposite. He just wants some time alone, time to de-compress and relax without having to talk to anyone-- including me. We are complete opposites in our wants and needs.

The Girls night out takes place overnight, starting at 11pm and walking for 10 miles around the city in a bright pink charity t-shirt, finishing up with refreshments at the end. It's very much an 'all girls together' night.
The Men's Day Out starts at 10 am, walks for just over 6 miles around the city (carefully routed past several pubs) in a black charity t-shirt, and finishes up with a free entry to our local rugby club to watch a match, and a free pie dinner. It's not unusual to see huge groups of men doing the event in fancy dress as a stag night.

I'm not a pink girly girl. I love watching rugby. I'd much rather go on the 'Men's' event. It's shorter, not at night, goes past pubs and you get a pie! I was joking with some male friends who are planning to go, that I'd sign up just using my initial - not my first name - and join them. They thought it was funny and even talked about getting me a fake moustache to wear and if anyone asked, that I 'identified as a man that day, and encouraged me to sign up.

That's what made me suddenly feel uneasy. I don't want to make light of anyone who is genuinely trans. And using self-identifying as a punchline seems so wrong.
But I'm still annoyed that these events are basically segregated into the two genders... pink tutu girlies and sports loving beer drinking fellers. At the end of the day, I would be raising money for the charity and I could easily be missed in the couple of thousand men taking part.

When I was sober, he reminded me of this fact, and I told him I didn't want to pay anymore, and I'm sorry I offered that. He said he didn't know if he wanted to go anymore, so I offered to pay 50% because I was really desperate for the trip to happen and I needed more people.  

This was last week. After reflecting on this, I realize I don't want to pay for any of it and I think he manipulated me. Although it still is my fault for getting drunk and offering in the first place.  The biggest reason I want to rescind the offer is that he has pulled some bad stuff with money in the past. For example, one time we split a bottle of liquor and he thought I drank a couple more shots than him, so when I Venmo requested him, he demanded me re-Venmo request him the liquor minus $1.50. A couple months ago, we all planned to go away for a fall cabin so I counted him in, and booked the AirBnb, we actually planned this trip together. Then the day before he decides he doesn't want to go, leaving me with the whole bill. He refuses to pay his part because he isn't going. But it was too late to cancel. In general, he plans nothing but expects to be catered to. But this is his birthday weekend, and I offered to pay. In general, I tend to be overly accommodating and plan everything, put it on my card, make concessions, and try to acquiesce to people when they aren't happy which is how I got myself into this situation in the first place, because I offered something I wasn't willing to give and I will resent him for it. WIBTA if I told him I made a mistake and he could either pay his entire lodging, or not come? Or should I suck it up? 50% of his lodging for me would be $60 extra, so I would pay $200 instead of $140. I can afford it, but so can he, he makes great money.

"evcgtb","1580248952","AITA for not tipping my tattoo artist?","A few years ago, I found a Craigslist ad for a new tattoo artist in my town. He was looking for someone to walk around downtown and pass out flyers for him. In exchange, he was willing to do a piece for free. I was young and had always wanted a tattoo but had never felt justified in sinking a lot of money into it. This seemed to be a golden opportunity for me. 

I went down to the shop he worked in and offered to pass out the flyers. After I had finished, I walked back and chatted with the guy about what I was thinking of for the tattoo. I told him the animal I wanted, the colors I'd like used, and where I'd like to have it done (my calf).

A few days later he called me and said that he had finished with his sketch and wanted me to come in and approve it. I went back, loved the drawing and gave him the thumbs up. This was when things started to go downhill. 

I had told him previously that I wanted it on my calf but he started really pressuring me to do it on my foot. I reiterated that I wanted it on my calf. He continued to push me to do it on my foot saying that it would fit perfectly across the whole top of my foot. I told him that this was my first tattoo and that I had heard that the foot was an extremely sensitive area to tattoo and that I wasn't sure that it would be the way to go for my first time. He assured me that the foot area really wasn't so bad and that he didn't think I would have any issues. After some hesitation, I agreed. He was the professional and I trusted his opinion.

Fast forward to time to have the tattoo done. I consider myself one to have a relatively high pain tolerance (part of why I trusted his opinion that it wouldn't be so bad) but once he started, I realized what a grave mistake I had made. It hurt like a bitch. I was fighting back tears but managed to keep a cheery disposition and chat with him while he worked. 

After he had finished up with the lines, I stepped out for a smoke so I could take a couple of minutes to regather myself. During those few minutes, my foot started to swell up immensely. So when I sat back down for him to start doing color, the pain had doubled and my foot was starting to bleed pretty badly.

By then I was no longer able to keep up good conversation and tears were starting to roll down my face. That's when this guy started LAUGHING at me. He told me that he loved talking girls into getting tattooed on the foot because he really enjoyed seeing them cry. I got angry as hell. I didn't say another word to him while he finished up. Once he was done, I let him go over the after care sheet, grabbed my things and walked out. 

I felt totally justified in not tipping him for his work but I had friends tell me that, even though he was a jerk, I still should've tipped him since the tattoo was free. Maybe I overreacted to his comment and was just overly sensitive due to the discomfort that I was in.

My wedding is scheduled for Saturday, February 15. I am 28M, my girlfriend is 26F. My brother is 26M, and I (obviously) invited him to my wedding, along with his 25F girlfriend. We have already gotten back all RSVPs, and both of them confirmed that they plan to go (Side note: my brother is NOT the best man; my 28M friend is. I just wanted to clear that up).

OK, so three days ago, my brother texted me a photo of him holding an engagement ring with the word ""Soon"". He has been dating his girlfriend for the past 3 years or so, so I was very excited that he was finally going to pop the question. I told him that I was happy for him, and I asked him if he intended to do it within the coming days. He responded, ""I'll probably do it at your wedding.""

I was shocked. Are you kidding me, dude? I thought it was common knowledge that you're not supposed to propose (or announce pregnancies) at someone else's wedding. I asked him if he was joking and he said no. I told him that he should definitely not do it, as it would be seen as disrespectful to me and my soon-to-be wife. He told me that it ""seems like a good time"" because they would be together with the rest of his family.

I was worried at this point, so I warned him that if he kept saying that he would propose AT MY WEDDING, then I would have to uninvite both him and his girlfriend. He said that that was extremely rude. I responded that I will allow him to go if he promised not to propose.

That should've been the end of it, but he kept insisting that it would be a good time to propose. I called him and told him that I would seriously uninvite him and take him off the list. He said ""OK fine"" while sighing. I asked him not to bring the engagement ring to the wedding. He said that he would bring it ""just in case.""

When I woke up the next morning, I contacted my wedding venue and asked them to take my brother's name, along with his girlfriend, off of the list of their table. The next day (yesterday), I told him what I did. He was shocked and angry. He told my parents, and they almost immediately called me and told me that they were disappointed.

To clean the windows I have to go into the front ""yard"" of the resident below and put up a ladder or use a long rod. 

Today the resident who lived below came out and yelled at me for trespassing. She said that she had tolerated for long enough, that I came onto her property every other month and that she wanted me to to leave at once.
I explained that it was necessary for me to do so, in order to clean the windows but she said that if I didn't leave she would call the police, she also threatened to go to the building supervisor and the board, and also sue me for ""making a mess"" in her front yard.

The apartments in the building are kind of wierd in that they sort of overlap each other. So there is, in fact, only a single window that is on top of her particular apartment. On top of that, that window is placed just above a small canopy above the front door  which prevents any water that I spill from ever reaching anything in her front ""yard"".

The ""yard"" is a small 40-50 square foot paved enclosure with a 1.5 foot tall fence, so it's not exactly private or closed off.

It takes me under a minute to go in, clean the window and get out.

Usually, I would react nicely to someone coming at me like that. Maybe even offer to clean a couple of her windows for free, once in a while. But she was so angry, condescending and quite frankly abusive that I lost my temper.

I said that I had every right to be here and that, since she only rented the place she had no authority to deny me access to the windows above her. (I've checked it before. The Danish real estate laws are quite clear about this. Legally I am allowed to do so, even if she did own the place)
But she told me to leave and slammed the door.

I decided to go ahead and clean the window anyway, (granted, a little out of spite) and as expected she came out and started yelling at me again. I once again said that she was more than welcome to call whomever she wanted, and that I was allowed to be there.

She then threatened with lawsuits, said that she would call the supervisor right away and that she would make sure I would never get any work on that street ever again.

It was beyond me when I heard this. I don’t want some random worker from her startup (which hasn’t made any money or minimum viable product yet) staying at our home while I’m away at work. 

I’m sorry I’m not giving great context and background. I just heard these words from her and was so dumbfounded. I said I’m not gonna be the guy who works a boring 9-5 so that she can mentor a future employee at home. In return, I was met with fire and fury from her for shitting on her dreams. This whole apartment search may be a disaster, but am I the asshole for not being okay with this???","False","Not the A-hole","7","24"

So basically he talks while his sleeping, usually just mumbles something about what happened that day for few minutes. 

I’m an extremely light sleeper so everything wakes me up. Few days ago his talking woke me up as usual. He was mentioning a guy’s name(Let’s say Rick for example). He kept repeating it and said “hide” few times. I kinda shook him and he stopped. 

When I asked him about it the next day he told me it was probably something random he heard on tv or something like that, but that night the same exact thing happened. I didn’t touch him because I wondered how long he’d keep repeating it. 35 fucking minutes of chanting “Rick”. He never does that, he usually mumbles for like 3-5 minutes. 

I recorded that and showed it to him the next day. He got really mad, he threw the phone away and said that I was being weird. I tried to talk to him, but he left, he came back late and slept on a couch. He’s acting distant towards me.","False","No A-holes here","3","42"

"evcux2","1580250433","AITA for not taking a side during a family argument?","A couple days ago, i found out my son met a woman called Ayumu while he lived in Japan. She's nice, but she doesn't speak a lot of English. I like her, she's nice and polite, but a little shy. Things were relatively quiet, until my father showed up.

My father is a vietnam vet and not shy about blurting out slurs. He fought in Vietnam and has a poor view of Asian's in general. He's gotten pretty mean and hateful in his old age. I tried to prevent him from visiting because of this and i knew it'd lead to a fight. But he insisted on coming over to treat us all at a restaurant, for my brother's birthday. All birthdays, the family goes out to eat together, he usually pays for it all.

But he just showed up. He saw my son and Ayumu sitting on the couch watching tv together. The first thing out of his mouth was ""Who's the (Racial Slur)?"". (I want to mark out some of the hateful slurs he uses, i don't want to offend anyone). My son rolled his eyes and my dad said ""Don't roll your eyes at me, boy. You're not too big for the belt"". I explained the situation to him and he just went ""Great."" with a sigh.

He started getting drunk and things started firing out. He asked Ayumu a question, and she kind of just stared at him, she said something in Japanese to him. He got mad and flung his hand into the air ""Oh great, figures she don't speak no God Damn English"".

Then, came time for the restaurant. We all got ready to leave, my son told his wife something and she started to get dressed. My dad asked ""What's she doing?"", my son explained she'd come with us but he said ""I'm not paying for her. This ain't a damn charity.""

After An entire day of this, my son had enough and spoke up for him and his wife. They argued, my dad said ""I can't believe you'd marry someone like her. She's probably just using you for a damn green card. I'm trying to look out for you."" My son told him that he loved her and it doesn't matter what he said. My dad said ""I can't believe you'd love someone that flew the planes that shot at me in Vietnam, her relatives probably tried to shoot your great granddaddy. ANd you go and marry one.""

His wife started to cry when the argument got heated (i think she could tell it was about her), he looked at me and said ""Dad, a little help here."".

"evd4dw","1580251469","AITA for wanting to go hiking alone against my boyfriend's wishes?","It's pretty simple, really.

I \[F28\] love adventures, exploring, outdoors, hiking, mountains, all that fun jazz.

I am also very independent, consider myself to be clear-minded, not lacking common sense, and have been adventuring (wilderness backpacking, hiking, outdoor ice and sport climbing, cycling, skiing etc) for all of my adult life. I have also done an outdoor winter survival course and dated a man whose dad was an outdoor survival instructor, from whom I have learned a lot.

Essentially, I'm not stupid and I understand the risks of doing things alone in the wilderness, of which there are more than sitting on your couch at home.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, doesn't really like any of those things and has never really done them (other than hiking, which I've taken him on). He's very intelligent but doesn't quite match my - zest and knowledge - for the outdoors, which I think is important to note because he has more of a distrust for nature, whereas I believe I have a healthy respect for nature.

All that aside, recently I expressed interest in going hiking solo, in the event he didn't want to come with and I wasn't able to find a friend to go with. Hiking solo is something I've also always wanted to do. This (day) hike would be in the Canadian Rockies in a very populated area. I feel like this doesn't need to be said, but I would obviously choose a popular time of year, day, and area so that I'm not just going out in the middle of nowhere.

When I told him that I'd love to do this his immediate reaction was ""no that is way too dangerous, you need to go with someone"". It turned into an argument.

His argument is that the risk of solo hiking is not worth the reward; that I should always go with someone; that regardless of what my reasons are for wanting to do it, it's more important that I come back to him at the end of the day and that I'm not a statistic in hiking deaths.

My argument is that I am very aware of all the risks, I definitely don't want to injure myself or die, and I have taken all of those things into account and still decided the risk would be worth it. I know how to prepare myself and would do all my research beforehand, but if things did go south that's something I was willing to deal with.

I feel like he has no trust or respect for me to take care of myself and to do it safely, even given the fact that I have always been the one to do the preparations and research before our hikes. He feels like I am not taking his concerns seriously and that it's an unnecessary risk. He told me he needs to know my ""reasons"" for wanting to do it alone before knowing if he can respect them. I told him that my reasons shouldn't matter and I just wanted him to support my decision and help me prepare, rather than fight me on it.

Reddit, AITA for refusing to budge on this?

Edit: Before this gets into an r/relationships ""Break up!"" post, he's not refusing to let me go, but he is making it very clear that he's unhappy about it, which affects how happy I will be about doing this.

Should I stop acting like I see through them and be phoney, or continue with my current ‘no bullshit’ presence?","Soooooo, me and my partner have been together 6 years, known each other since nursery and have 2 kids together.

Now before we had the kids, we lived in a small flat, never really met his sister before and had spent time with his mother a few times and got on fairly well to say I was only 18.

Now, to say I hadn’t had any interaction with his mum the whole time we moved out, she suddenly called him up one night when we was relaxing at home with some friends. She’d been drinking (shock) and out of the blue just started calling me every name she could think of, saying I wasn’t good enough for him, that I was a lazy bastard (because I was in between jobs, for 1 month) that he needed to leave me, and she didn’t like me.  Now I swear this came from absolutely nowhere. But fine, here we are.

After that night nothing was said. Normally, if I was allowed to handle it myself I would have had a conversation with her myself and dealt with her how I saw fit, but with it being his mother I respected HIS wishes and left it. 

A year and a half goes by and I’m pregnant, my partner wants to tell his mother, my thought process was “I don’t need this shit” but anyway, as I do because I love my partner I go with him. She immediately acts like nothing has happened and that she was soooo pleased to see me. Finally, he tells her and she acts pleased (whether she was I have my doubts about) and gives me a hug and says “olive branch now love” I was like fine. 

Now present day, since having my baby who is now 2& a half, a few things have happened where she has said some nasty things, which I dealt with personally and she retreated and played the victim, great tactic. 
Anyway, now she visits my sons every Friday and acts like she really likes me, along with my partners sister.

Just a background on the sister, I thought we got on quite well once we started speaking, until I learned that she shares every opinion her mother has because she he no real integrity, so if the mother doesn’t like you, neither does the sister. My thoughts got proved when I saw some texts they sent to each other claiming I’m “boring, predictable and they worry for my mental state” all because I posted on Instagram about nobody offering to take my children out.

Anyway, when they visit, I’m very cold and formal with them. Don’t get me wrong I’m polite, but I don’t engage in conversation, I probably do come across as rude, but I can’t help it. I’ve always been a call a spade a spade kinda person, and I’m very good at reading people, their intentions and thoughts. So I find it difficult to not address or acknowledge the bullshit that’s staring me in the face.

So I guess, what I’m asking is; am I the arsehole for not being the bigger person and trying to make a relationship with them or am I right to stick with my instincts and keep them arms length away from me, for my own protection?","False","Not the A-hole","3","28"

"evda7w","1580252079","AITA for ignoring my needy coworker and causing her to be late?","I am a child welfare social services worker for a private agency. We have a small office of only 4 workers and 1 supervisor. 


3 of the 4 workers use the option to work at home 2 days per week. Because of this, as well as because we all have required field work (home visits), we have a rotating schedule in which 1 person is required to be in the office 08:30AM-05:00PM each day. We sign up for office coverage days 1 month in advance, so there's no surprises about when we need to be in. 


I agreed to come in today, on my work at home day, from 5-7PM. My boss asked me yesterday morning first thing if I could do this. The need for me to be in was because a coworker (I'll call her Maddie) from our sister office one county over has a meeting with a client in our office from 04:30PM to 07:00PM. The client is known to be aggressive, and Maddie does not feel comfortable being alone in the office with them, especially after hours when the other businesses in our building are closed. 


I have no issue helping out Maddie. She's sweet, respectful, and an asset to our agency. 


My problem is with my coworker Leah. She was scheduled to be our office coverage today. She was expected to be in the office until 5PM. With about three hours notice, she texted me to ask me to come in at 4:30 instead of 5. She planned a home visit 25 minutes away from our office to start at 5. She did this knowing that she was supposed to be in the office until 5. 


As background, Leah is very frustrating to be around. She has limited self awareness and social skills. She struggles with organization and punctuality. She constantly asks others for help, often with things that she could very well do herself, but chooses not to due to her own laziness. An example of this is that she always wants me to take her clients' completed drug screens to the ups dropbox. The dropbox is literally in the front of our building, just across the parking lot. I do this for her because it gives me a quick outdoors break, and I like to be physically active as much as I can. She, on the other hand, often scoots from one side of the room to the other while sitting down...because she doesn't want to stand up. 


Regardless of her flaws, I know her heart is in the right place. It takes a certain type of person to go into child welfare, and I know her job is difficult. It's difficult even for the best workers. I understand that she is a human being and deserves my compassion, even if my personal feelings toward her are negative. 


However, I also feel that I need to keep my healthy boundaries in order to be the best professional I can be. I do not feel obligated to go out of my way to help her, particularly when the issue is a result of her poor planning. Could I have come in at 430? Yes, but I did not feel it was my responsibility. I ignored her text, and when she called me at 4:20 I ignored that too. The result of me arriving at 4:50 was that she was late to her visit.

I told her I was busy as my cousin on my dad's side was having a birthday party for their kid and wanted me to be there. So I agreed to attend as he asked me back in November. 

I told my grandmother this and she asked when the party was over and I told her 2pm. So she set up for everyone to get together at 2:30pm and I said that was fine. I texted her in the morning that Saturday to ensure the plans were still good at which point she said they were. I silenced my phone and went to the party(this was around 11:30). During the party around noon my grandmother had called me to tell me the plans were cancelled but to see if I wanted to do something with her anyway (I did not answer as i didn't hear my phone ring. I checked phone and voice mail after party) and when I didn't answer when she called me back at 1230 she said she would never bother me again or ask me to go do anything ever again unless I apologized.

Fast forward to yesterday when she called to ask if I could come help her with some house work and that it would only take a few hours after work. She gets mad at me because I had plans every night she wanted to do this and would not take my offer up of doing it this Saturday. Now the family is mad at me because I refuse to spend time with or help my grandmother and they want me to apologize to her and go help her out. 

My grandmother does let me store some things in her attic and I usually never have any problems with going to help her with yard work(she lives on 5 acres of land) or chores around the house when ever she asks. No other Grandchild or any of her own two daughters or their husbands are willing to go help her out I was the only one who would help on a regular basis.

His only response to That  was that he felt he had to be blunt with me but no explanation why. 
He almost never says anything positive about my appearance, nothing negative either but I’m always telling him he looks good or he’s handsome etc. and I watch his face light up every time.

She didn't ask me for money or anything, but asked to eventually get a puppy off the dog. She signed its papers to me and everything. She got the dog because her friend was a breeder and this female was new to her breeding program, but her house burned down and she had to rehome all her dogs. Last year I bred the bitch after finishing titling her and passing health exams (her and the stud, who I also own). Had a very healthy litter and went to my friend and since you want your puppy? She said not yet, she needed some time and would wait for the next litter. 

My friend had a really abusive bf. She has 3 kids with him. I and many people told her that he was emotionally and verbally abusive, and after a year of that she realized physical abuse wasnt the only abuse there was. She left him, and started custody proceedings. Then he handed her his credit card, and said if she came back she could have access to all his money, not just the child support. She lives in a very poor area and was struggling to feed herself, her kids, and her dogs alone. So she said yes and went back to him. 

Now shes with him again and he is CONTROLLING. She cant visit her friends or family because when she did last, he threatened to kill her dog unless she came back. 

I have a litter again, a year later. She really wants a puppy. I am extremely uncomfortable with having a puppy live with that man, and in her life situation.

"evdyu3","1580254738","AITA for wanting to turn of location tracking services my parents use after I leave for college?","So my parents use the iPhone service find my friends to follow my location when they “feel worried” about me which as it is kind of bugs me. The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have me text when I’m leaving and when I’m arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when I’m with friends but it is what it is. For background I’m a 17 year old high school senior with straight A’s and also take a couple college courses (at my parents request) on the side. I will also be turning 18 before I go away for college. My parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about my and my 20 year old sister’s safety. For my sister, my mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazes me that she is okay with this.

At this time, I allow the service because I am not an adult and have little to no pull on them (ie when I had to argue with them for years about my 9 o’clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however I told them that once I go to college, I will be turning off the service on my phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. My parents argue that if I have nothing to hide, what’s the harm. They also argue that if I’m somewhere and I need help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which I have no intention of joining.

To me however, I view this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes me feel very uncomfortable, not because I plan on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because I don’t want to followed and monitored because it not only degrading me to the status of child, but also shows that my parents don’t trust me. Furthermore, it comes off to me that my parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect my boundaries. In case it is important, when we last had this argument, they said if I didn’t keep the service enabled on my phone then they will be cutting me off, to which I replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent me from calling them for help in the event that I actually needed it.

Some extra information in case it is needed:
-the college I plan on attending is about 3 hours away
-I am a straight A student
-I have zero history of risky behavior(drinking, drugs, smoking/vaping)

About 6 months ago I threw out our honey jar because she spilled honey down the side of it, every time she used it, which ended up getting sticky honey all over our counter tops and things in the cupboard where it was stored. This was particularly frustrating for me because I love honey and HATE wasting food, but I had cleaned the honey up after her numerous times and repeatedly asked her to be careful with it. But I'd rather not have honey in the house than fight over something so small. 

She also spills laundry detergent down the sides of the bottle every time she uses it, but I've let that go because sometimes you need to pick your battles..

Last night I was looking through the freezer for something to make for dinner, when I picked up a tub of ice cream. The lid, sides, and bottom of the ice cream container were all sticky with spilt ice cream. I'm not even sure how she managed this. I considered rinsing it off and putting it back, but before I could turn the sink on, I realized both of my hands were sticky, so I just decided to toss it into the trash. Again, this was hard for me because I hate food waste, but I was not in the mood for cleaning up after her again. 

Later that night she asked me where the ice cream was. I confessed that I had tossed it because it was a mess. She broke into tears because she is PMSing and was looking forward to eating the icecream, I guess because it makes PMSing easier? She stormed off crying.

She thinks I'm an asshole. I kinda feel bad for maybe making her PMS worse. But I also feel like she should clean up after herself and if she really cares about things, she should treat them well. Am I the asshole here?","False","Everyone Sucks","7","45"

I felt bad for the man. He said he had been here since Friday (it's Tuesday night right now) and hadn't eaten and just wanted to get back to Paris. I took him to a fast food place and bought him some food. I had no problems about this. It's really hard to be in a random country and not speak the language. I asked him how he got here and the story seemed a little bullshit to be honest. He said he came to visit his friend but his friend just fucked off to Italy. He also didn't have a passport. 

Once we left the chicken shop, he started begging me for a ticket to London from Manchester Piccadilly. These are about £20. I'm a student. I work part time and make £45 a week. I don't have a lot of money but if I really wanted to, I probably could have. I didn't. He was begging, he seemed desperate, so I felt like a bit of a cunt for leaving him like that.

I drive a somewhat fancy car and sometimes I like to drive hard. I don't ever speed on local roads but I do occasionally accelerate hard after a light. I have 0 ticket and 0 accidents. I even go out with friends for track days to get my speed rush in.

So anyway, we are driving home from the gym and I'm first at a red light. When the light turns green I floor it. The road is 60kph and I hit 60 and hit the breaks to keep at 60. 2 seconds later I see the lights behind me. I didn't even realize at first I was being pulled over so I just slow down and pull to the right. The cop pulls up behind me and I'm a bit confused but whatever. I know I didn't do anything wrong. 

We do the whole ""do you know why I pulled you over dance"" and he goes back to his car. He said the reason was speeding and reckless driving. I told him I definitely wasn't speeding and didn't go a km over 60. To this my wife squeezes my arm but I'm a bit angry at this point. 

15 mins later he comes back and tells me that he's going to let me off with a warning but to drive more carefully. I asked him what the warning is for and he said driving irresponsibly. 

I probably should've dropped it at this point but this was pissing me off. I told him what I did to drive irresponsibly and he said I was speeding. I told him if that's the case then to write me a ticket and I can see him in court with my dashcam footage which has the speed on it. 

He asked me ""are we really going to do this?"" and i replied with something along the lines of wanting either a reason for being pulled over or an apology. He goes back to his car and writes me 2 tickets for speeding (20 over) and stunt driving. What a joke. 

My wife is now furious with me because I pretty much guaranteed our insurance premiums going up for no reason. I told her that there is no way our premiums are going up cause I have the dash cam footage plus I actually did nothing wrong. 

I don't even want to get a lawyer for this because it's honestly complete bullshit that should be thrown out. 

I know I should've kept my mouth shut because nothing good could come out of it but I don't think I was being an asshole to the cop. I just want him to do his job properly. If I was speeding I want the actual ticket for speeding. Don't let me off just cause you feel like it.

Edit: alright will accept that I'm TA but a few things I want to clarify 

I was going 60kph (37mph). I literally have video evidence of this. The cop gave me a ticket for going 20 over.

When I say I braked to stay under 60 I don't mean I hit 60 then immediately braked. When I get to 50-55 I apply slight pressure to stop accelerating. 

There were no cars in front of me or pedestrians even close to the intersection. 

I drive hard occasionally because I enjoy driving my car. Been driving almost 20 years and haven't had  a single ticket or accident. 

I am just clarifying all these things because people were making presumptions in the comments.","1580258278.0","Asshole","5","108"

"eve8qp","1580255864","AITA for sending grandma to her death?","I post this is on behalf on my mom who wholeheartedly believes she's an asshole for this. I disagree and so it's up to you, reddit strangers, to decide.

... 

My mom is in her 50s and around 10yrs back, she quit her job to take care of her dying dad (cancer). After he died, period of attending to grandma ensued. 

Grandma decided to keep living at her own place - a big house with even bigger garden in a village around half an hour by car from my parents. Because a priest told her that her husband's soul ""is home with her."" 

So every weekend, shopping, cleaning, taking care of the garden, everything was done by my mom alone while she also worked, took care of her own place and of my dad who's also very sick (cancer again). 

Things periodically worsened to current state. Now grandma (94) destroyed her TV - she forgot what it is and tried to move it. Tried to boil water in an electric kettle by placing it on the cooker. Blames people for stealing things she owned 50yrs ago. Calls in the middle of night looking for her daughter because she has to prepare her for school (obviously meaning mom and forgetting she's already an adult). Calls relatives to tell them she hasn't seen mom in months. Loses money so my mom covers most of her bills. She's aggressive when mom cleans there and she basically abuses her cats (forgets to feed them or doesn't hesitate to kick them when they get under her feet).

Now, my mom is loosing touch (nerves in hands don't work properly due to overworking herself for years, it's either operations or losing her touch completely). No driving to grandma's for a year. Her life seems over, taking care of two people who are going through life with ""I'm just waiting to die and I don't give a fuck anymore."" ideology.

So I made her do the first step and got grandma to the doctor. She has mixed dementia and Alzheimers. After that, we made calls to the appropriate facilities, the best ones we could find. Expensive, as luxurious as this goes, but it's still a one way ticket. If she'll go there, she'll never return home, we won't see her so often due to the distance and doctor believes it won't take long when you take old person from their environment... 

Grandma said she'll never forgive mom and will hate her forever... She obviously just wants her house and is an ungrateful bitch. 

(She forgot she said that next day.) 

Mom thinks she's an asshole and cries day and night because she's sending her mother somewhere against her will to basically die. 

Is she?

...

TL;DR: Mom sacrificied her health and ten years of her life to grandma's wish to live alone in a huge house. Now grandma became danger to herself and others - she has Alzheimers and mixed dementia - but keeps saying she won't forgive mom if she moves her against her will.

We are both divorced and due to shared custody with our ex’s we maintain separate houses, so we live about an hour and a half away from each other. This weekend, my son (10) has two extracurricular events and a birthday party, basically all Saturday morning and afternoon and Sunday morning. He doesn’t have friends outside of school, so I am extra supportive of him fostering friendships. My partner is having an elective dental procedure on Saturday that he is choosing to get sedation during. So, he needs a ride to his appointment. Three weeks ago, we realized that the appointment was the same day as two of my son’s activities. I asked for him to reschedule, but he insisted on keeping the appointment and said that it was fine for me to be away that weekend. Today, he started acting cold toward me and started a huge fight over this. He did find a ride to the appointment, but now says that I’m not there for him and said “let’s call it quits”. I say that him not being honest with me about his feelings from start isn’t my fault and that I shouldn’t be punished for it. AITA?

UPDATE
I think he realized that he was being unreasonable. I offered a compromise that would enable me to take him to his procedure and still allow for my son to participate in the tournament and birthday party. It would mean an extra four hours of driving and missing part of the tournament, but at least I wasn’t leaving anyone out and I would be there for my son too. He said that he was alright with me not being there. So, I will be spending the weekend with my son as we had originally discussed. We had a long talk and he brought up some other things that had been bothering him, which may have contributed to his let’s call it quits mentality.

My daughter Anni is 17 and a senior in high school. She’s brilliant at English, history, philosophy, and similar classes. However, she has a learning disability called dyscalculia that hinders her math ability greatly. Her foreign language and science abilities are also affected to a lesser extent. That being said, she rose to every challenge and gave it her all, passing  the exams she needed to graduate with her IEP. Even if it was by one point! She took both the SAT and the ACT twice, but mainly applied to test optional schools with a great essay, and got into her “reach” choice early decision, meaning she is bound to go there and has to withdraw other applications. It’s a very good school (one of the seven sister colleges), and it took us all by surprise. 

Anni’s high school releases a booklet every spring that anonymously lists all graduating seniors GPA and SAT/ACT scores along with the colleges they’ll be going too. Students in future years use it as a grade guide. It is optional to have your child excluded from this. Because Anni is the only one in her class  going to her college, I felt like her grades would be easily recognizable, and her scores are NOT representative of her as a student since math and science are so negatively effected. Therefore, her mother, Anni and I together chose not to have her scores sent in when the time comes.

"evfc4t","1580260535","AITA for selecting my preferred seat on the train","First-time poster, so I hope I'm doing it all correctly.

This happened a while back but may happen again, so I’m curious to hear everyone’s take.

Every month or so I travel between two major U.S. cities on the train. I usually take the train that departs at 10am; it’s about a 3-hour trip. My “ideal” seat is in the “quiet car” (there’s only one “quiet car” on this train; the “quiet car” does not have assigned seats; it’s first-come, first -served). I also like to sit next to the window, specifically in a row where there are two contiguous windows instead of one window and then blank wall. I also like to sit on the side of the train where the morning sun is not shining in my eyes. The configuration of the train cars means that there are only four seats on the train that fit these criteria, so I make it a point to arrive early at the train station and to get in line as soon as the gate is announced to increase the chances that I can get one of these seats, and I usually do. If I don’t – oh, well, I just take another seat. 

So one time I was towards the front of the line when boarding started, and by the time I got to the “quiet car,” three of those four seats were already taken. The fourth seat was indeed empty, but a woman was getting settled into the aisle seat next to it. At this point there were only a handful of people in the train car, but usually this car (and the entire train – it’s a well-traveled route) gets pretty full once everyone has boarded (and sure enough, it did this day as well). It felt a little awkward saying to the woman in the aisle seat, “Do you mind if I sit there \[in the window seat next to her aisle seat\]?” because of all the other seats that were still empty at that moment. But if I sat in another seat, chances were good that someone would end up sitting in the seat that I preferred, and I figured that since it was first-come, first-served, so why shouldn’t I get the seat I preferred if no one else was sitting in that seat yet?

The woman said something like, “Why do you have to sit right next to me when there are all these empty seats?” and I truly don’t remember if I went into any great detail about why I preferred that seat, but I probably just said something like, “It’s next to the double window and the sun won’t be in my eyes.” She sighed and rolled her eyes and made it clear from her body language that she was not happy that I wanted to sit it that seat, but she did move over and let me pass. And sure enough, within a few minutes (before the train departed), pretty much all of the seats in the car were filled.

 tl;dr: WITA for asking for my preferred seat in a first-come, first-served train car even though someone was sitting next to that seat, and the car had not yet filled up with passengers but would within a few minutes? (I’m a middle-aged female, in case that makes a difference to anyone.)

So I have this friend, let’s call her Sophie (random name). She asked me out in year 7 and I politely declined and we got on as friends. 

Fast forward to now and we’re in year 9, for my birthday I get the chance to go to any convention I would like with a friend and I choose her and ask if she wants to go, which she says yes to. About a week later she tells me she likes me, and that she’s liked me since the first time she asked me out. This a big surprise and again I politely declined, and since she already has a partner I’m not sure what her plan was there. 

I don’t feel like I can go to the con with her anymore, it’s really awkward between us and I just need a break from her for a while especially since she has a lot of her own stuff going on on the side as do I and things just aren’t right between us anymore. I feel really guilty about it though but I tried to be as nice about it as I could without hurting her feelings.

"evfh7r","1580261148","AITA for not talking to my dad","I’m a teenager living at home with both my parents and recently I’ve decided to stop talking to my dad. 

My whole life I’ve been verbally and sometimes physically abused by my dad but he never apologized for his actions. Instead he would act like nothing happened. He would make my mom cry and then mock her for it. He would also insult her behind her back constantly. He’s always yelling, threatening me and gets mad over the smallest things and gets super angry with me when I try to defend myself or even if I stay silent. 

He’s not always like this though. We tend to have a good relationship sometimes. We’ll laugh, watch movies together, go out to eat etc... but those moments don’t cover up the bad ones. 

Recently his temper has been so much worse and I’ve talked to my mom about it and how ever since I was a kid I never loved my dad. She still tries to convince me to try to have a good relationship with him and just “don’t talk back” (which I don’t anymore but apparently everything that comes out of my mouth is talking back) She’s just always defending him and even though she says she’s not taking his side, I feel like she is. One of the things that bothers me most is that whenever he’s done saying what he has to say and making me cry, he asks me if I still love him which I’ve already said I don’t but I always lie and say that I do. 

So i’ve decided to stop talking to him and only say hi, bye, yes, no and thank you. It’s only been two days and he’s already complaining to my mom about how I’m ignoring him and being disrespectful but he hasn’t said a word to me either so pretty much, he’s just making me look like the bad guy. My mom got mad at me and says I’m going to cause more problems because I don’t want to talk to him. Me and him have been through his multiple times where we won’t talk for a couple days but everything just goes back to normal (us being the fake happy family) This time I really want to stop. I still can’t help but to think, AITA for ignoring him? and should I just go back to talking to him and just deal with his anger issues like I have been my whole life?

One guy talked about jumping off a swing and breaking his arm, then someone said they swallowed a coin and almost choked, someone else got a bead stuck up their nose. Everyone was laughing at these stories. I started telling my story which I thought fit with what they were talking about.

This one wasn't chocolate, it was made of glass. My Mom found me with blood pouring out of my mouth. I've always thought this was just a funny story. Nobody laughed. They were all just like ""wtf are you okay?"" ""That's disgusting"". It was pretty awkward. 

I stayed kinda quiet for the rest of the night. My girlfriend texted me the next day and asked why I thought it was a good idea to creep everyone out last night with my morbid story.

TLDR at the bottom

Ok here goes.... my (29F) partner (34M) and I had a baby 4 months ago. He’s a business owner and hasn’t taken any time off since I’ve had the baby. I think he took like the day we had her off and that’s it lol. I’m currently on an 18 month paid maternity leave. 

He’s been working A LOT since the baby to the point where I hardly get to spend any time with him. He does work from home a lot so I do see him. but I wouldn’t count this as spending ‘quality time’ together. I always ask to do something on the weekend like go for a hike or grab lunch/coffee and he always says he has no time and/or money. 

So he comes home today and says ‘tom’ (not real name, his business partner) is snowboarding and wants him to go up tomorrow and meet him. I’m already in a pretty bad mood as I’ve spend my entire day cleaning the house and now the baby is crying. So I just sort of give him a look and don’t say anything. Then he starts laughing and goes ‘Haha I knew it! I knew you’d be like this. I told Tom you wouldn’t want me to go’ I just got up went to the bedroom and slammed the door. 

We argued for a bit and he ended up leaving. I sent him some texts basically saying the reason I got so upset was that he never has time or money to do anything fun with me or the baby but suddenly he has a whole week day to go snowboarding with Tom. Also I though he had no money to do stuff like this. I said this hurt my feelings and made me feel like you didn’t care about us (me and baby). His argument is that he spends all his time working so he should be able to do what he wants. I said if he had been spending time with us, going on hikes or whatever regularly then I would have no problem with it, but i don’t see how he has time to go snowboarding if he doesn’t have time for the family. So AITA?? 

I’ll add in that things are split pretty evenly money wise between us. He pays for rent, bills, groceries. I pay for all my own stuff plus anything that the baby needs. He did say he would split the stroller with me because it was quite expensive..... i needed new winter tires for my car so the trade off was he’d buy me tires if I paid for the stroller. He never bought tires or paid me for the stroller. So his argument that he spends all his time working I feel is kind of invalid because I contribute just as much as he does. 

OH AND ALSO after all this he says ‘I already told Tom I couldn’t go because I was busy but just wanted to see how you’d react and I was right’

My sister (25) is doing a work-research thing in Europe, and for my (14f) school winter break me and my parents wanted to fly over and visit since my sister was going back home for a couple of weeks right after the break ended. Well, my parents couldn’t get the time off so they flew me to my sister. Nothing happened on the flight there, was a cool experience flying alone for the first time. It was a great vacation with my sister. 

When it was time to leave, me and my sister had economy class tickets in the back of the plane - everyone was cramped together. It’s an 8 hour flight, but we figured it would be fine. 

About an hour into the flight, the guy in front of my sis started to recline his seat back, and my sister let him until she realized that he was basically lying on her chest. She felt really uncomfortable so she asked him to move his seat back up in English. He answered in Spanish so my sister asked again in Spanish, and then he started telling her in English that the person in front of him had moved his seat back and he had no room so just let him be. My sister asked him again but he just ignored her, so she managed to wedge her knees in between the seat and push the seat up herself so she had enough room. The seat was still reclined back, just not so much that we could literally see the top of his head. 

I guess he didn’t like that, cause he told my sister to move and she refused unless he stopped reclining his seat. He asked if I was traveling with her and when she said yes he turned to the person sitting next to him (his daughter? Idk she looked a little older than me) and told her to recline her seat in Spanish. I already had my knees up cause it was more comfortable for me, but she reclined until she hit my knees and then kept trying to recline more. I didn’t talk to her, and my sister was pissed and didn’t want to curse at a teen so she kept quiet. 

We had bought our own food so we didn’t have to move for the food service, so we were blocking their seats from moving back the whole entire flight. Occasionally, I would feel the girl try to move her seat back again but I was watching marvel movies so I didn’t really care. 

When the plane landed the people in front of us rushed off the plane but as we were getting off the people in the row next to the guy and girl told us that we were assholes and should have just let them recline. I feel kind of bad that they weren’t comfortable but neither were we.

"evfvif","1580262962","AITA for being offended over being criticised for “too juicy” burgers?","Okay, so this is a weird one and just something small that’s ticking me off still so I’ll try to keep it short:

I love cooking, it has become one of my passions and the thing is people are liking my food. I don’t always have the necessary freedom to experiment because of money and certain people so I try to do things to the best of my abilities while adding new methods or ingredients to something.

Now today my mum wanted burgers and I was left to cook store bought ones without interruption; as a result I decided to experiment and cook them differently to how she does it by seasoning, toasting buns and cooking the burgers how I watched it done on some cooking channels.

The results were some very juicy burgers cooked through to well done and not burnt, which I was personally pleased with. On the other hand my stepdad immediately complained about how the juice was dripping and the burgers were wrong, followed soon after by my mum telling me burgers aren’t meant to be juicy.

I have never heard anyone complaining about a burger being too juicy, or people saying that no burger place serves juicy burgers because they’re “greasy”. People, I ate the same burgers, I hate grease and that was not grease. 

I said that burgers are supposed to be juicy and that I never heard of someone complaining about too juicy burgers, they said I’d done it wrong and this went back and forth with me being called wrong. By this point I’m pissed, I don’t cook burgers and this was a first for me which I thought went well so I asked the two of them if they’d rather dry burnt mince slabs and told them that no one in their right mind thinks a burger should be the food equivalent of the Sahara.

From there my stepdad left (after eating all his food might I add) and my mum said that “he must’ve just been unlucky with his burgers” and tried giving me “advice” on how to make the burgers dry. I was done, I just left her at the table (she was also eating everything) to rinse off my plate.

I’m wondering if how I handled this was wrong; I’m used to my stepdad hating my food since his idea of “real food” is just frozen crap but my mum usually has real criticisms and feedback. It could just be a matter of preference and me getting touchy was uncalled for, at the same time I feel like they were overreacting to a change I made which they didn’t mind enough to stop eating.","1580309754.0","Not the A-hole","8","68"

She is a lot of work - can be manipulative and can definitely over step her boundaries. Everyone feels the same way about it. I let it go out of pity and the fact that I knew her when we were kids and our mums are on good terms.

But as time goes on she begins to date a friend of mine which she was introduced to due to spending so much time up here with me. Relationship was messy - basically was super possesive with him and turned a fun guy into a ""I'm gonna leave the party early cause my gf isn't feeling it"". Didn't let the guy hang out with his guy friends cause she wanted him with her, that kinda stuff. Everyone was wary of the relationship and it went on for a while. 

He finally called it off and all was well. Until she messages to let me know out of the blue she's pregnant and doesn't want to tell him because they're not together but she still loves him. She also told another friend of his but apparently that's it.

I think this is messed up that I know about this and he doesn't - he needs to know about this as its his kid. With her track record I don't know if she genuinely intends to keep out of his life or if she's gonna pull him back in with a child .

"evg0sl","1580263627","AITA for staying out late consistently, against my parents' wishes?","God, this is dumb, but here we are.

I (19M) am in my sophomore year of college in my home city. I am paying for 100% of my own college through academic scholarships, so I decided to stay with my parents (50'sMF) to save money, as the scholarships don't cover housing. In turn, they said they would help for stuff like gas and food, as long as I kept the scholarships. I have stayed out late plenty of times in the past for stuff. A lot of my friends live on or near campus, so I, of course, like to hang out with them. Sadly, because of full school and work schedules, sometimes that doesnt happen until late at night. Through all of this, my grades have been enough to keep the scholarships.

From the get go my parents were very clear: I did not have a curfew, but they did not sleep well when I wasn't home, so they preferred that I came home earlier. My mom needs to get up for work at 4, and my dad needs to get up at 5. I really did not let it affect my plans, as I view it as something they just need to get over, as I'm an adult. Last semester and before, I wasn't out past midnight all that often on weekdays, but that just kind of gradually changed recently. Mostly, I had been coming in between midnight and 1 during winter break, as I was taking a class and studying/hanging out with friends. My mother asked me to please come in before midnight on days she worked, so begrudgingly I agreed and made sure to be in earlier on those days. Throughout all of this, it was expected that I keep them updated on my location and about when I'd be home, which I did without fail. They also have Life360 on my phone, so they can see where I am at all times.

A few nights ago, I was watching a movie at a friend's house. I had already talked to my mom that I would be home around 2am; she does not work on Fridays and this was Thursday night. At around 12:45am I got an all caps text from my dad telling me to come home right then.

I arrived home to my dad yelling at me that letting me stay out late was a courtesy, and that I had been disrespectful to him by staying out late. He said I was selfish and irresponsible, and that I obviously was not ready to not have a curfew. He said that they pay for everything I ask, so I owe it to them to come home at a reasonable time. He believes that ""nothing good happens after 1am,"" so there's no need for me to really ever be out past that.

After a few hours, he came to the conclusion that my new curfew would be 10:30pm on weekdays, 2am on weekends. I absolutely hate it, and all my friends in college think it’s terrible and I need to move out ASAP. However, a lot of older people in my life think I was/am an ass, because they did start by reasonably asking me to be home earlier. I'm not sure.

So, AITA?

Edit: To clarify, I have talked to them both and it is not the waiting for me to come home that gets them, or even my noise level, it's that they ask me to wake them up to tell them I'm home, and they have difficulty falling asleep afterwards.","1580265306.0","Not the A-hole","4","49"

Polly decided to never have children and told LuAnn to direct her grandparent energy towards my kids. 

I'm divorced (almost 10 years) and their dads opted to not be involved financially or emotionally. We make due, but its tight. I don't really have any family to call on when I'm in a bind. Maybe if my lights got shut off, but not for frivolity. 

My girls graduate this year. I told them we'd take a road trip to celebrate. LuAnn got wind of this, and promised them a cruise instead. She invited me but I declined because I can't miss that much work, but I was really excited for my girls to travel. 

This was two years ago. 

Tonight, LuAnn asked me if I could give her $1200 to cover their plane tickets to get to their cruise. She said if I can't, the trip is ruined and she's wasted money because she can't afford that. 

The cruise is seven months from now, their bday is in a few days, they graduate in May, and I just got a good sized ER bill. I have a lot of expenses to cover and didn't know this would be one. 

I may be the asshole because I never asked if I should cover any part of it. I assumed she understood that's why I offered them a much less expensive trip. Also, if I were going to drop what for me is a lot of money, I'd rather have been able to spend time with them. 

LuAnn doesn't work, has worked maybe 5 years of her life. She's inherited a good chunk of money and her husband has a nice pension. That's not to say I think they owe my kids extravagant gifts, just... I don't think they understand $1200 is a LOT of money for me to come up with, especially on short notice. 

She's annoyed that I asked her to Not pay for the tickets tonight (with the expectation that I pay her back) because I want to see if there's a less expensive option. 

Honestly, this might be a deal breaker; we may just need to cancel. 

Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I feel pretty safe saying I'm not the asshole. I don't think LuAnn intended to be an asshole either. 

I'm going to see if I can find some tickets on my own and check out alternative travel options. I actually Love the idea of making getting there a road trip and part of the adventure.

When we first met I quite liked him. By 2 months in, however, some really disturbing habits began to emerge:

First was the smell. Each area he occupied in the apartment would smell horrific for 20-30 mins. Even my friends noticed. His feet were particularly bad. He also ate my food without attempting to replace it. Sometimes he'd ask permission, but other times not. I also found him chilling in his pajamas on my couch in the middle of the day while watching our TV on a regular basis during the workday. He is not on the lease.

He also smokes weed a lot and would even leave bits of weed smudged on our table. He and my roommate regularly smoked on the property and directly in front of the landlord's home. I personally don't care about their substance use except for the fact that we live in a state where this is illegal. If his weed were to be discovered in my apartment for whatever reason, I could be evicted. Moreover, any potential legal charge (including possession) can permanently bar me from my desired career path.

Lastly, he would burp and fart REALLY loudly and for prolonged periods. I'm talking 3-5 second burps and farts that would occur several times an hour at all parts of the day. He would even wake me up in the morning with his burps. I wish I were exaggerating.

I didn't want to embarrass him, so I chose to sit down face-to-face with my roommate and we had a long talk about his habits. She ultimately agreed that she had noticed a lot of these behaviors and said that she would talk to him. From then on, most of his behaviors really improved, at least for a while.

A couple of weeks ago the burping and farting resumed. Wanting to nip this in the bud, I texted my roommate last week about it. She claimed to not even notice it but agreed that she would tell him to try to control the burping/farting. Unfortunately, I don't think she followed through because the behavior continued. Earlier tonight, I heard him let out a prolonged 5-second burp through a closed door. I had enough. I opened my door and told him to quiet down the burping. My roommate immediately defended him, stating that it didn't bother her and he could not help it. He said something to the effect of ""that's how my body works."" and I said something like, ""then get some Tums or something because it's really gross.""

I personally think that he's exaggerating his burps and feels overly comfortable being a neanderthal in someone else's home. As someone who has a chronic digestive disorder, however, I am willing to accept that this is an unavoidable symptom of a larger issue, but he has never said anything to this effect. As someone who is spending an inordinate amount of time at home between work and school obligations, having a home that feels peaceful and inviting is really important to me.

I’m the president of a fairly small club at my school. Due to the fact that the members of the club were all seniors last year (except for me), I was left with the sole responsibility of managing the club this year. At the beginning of the school year, I announced that I was going to be monitoring the dedication of the club members to the club. If people stood out to me as hard workers or they dedicated a lot of time to the club, I would take note and make them a permanent board member. This was to both reward hard work and to lessen the burden on my shoulders. Over the following months, three people caught my attention: two fellow juniors and one freshman. They all put in extra effort, came to organized activities outside of club meetings, and helped me plan events. One day, I pulled each three aside and discussed with them privately that I was going to make them board members. A couple of days after, I get a text from one of my friends. This was a person that came to the first meeting, and maybe one or two after that. Keep in mind that we meet weekly, and we also have organized events and activities. This person is also a junior, and they asked me if they could be considered for the board position I was giving to the freshman. I said no, sorry, but I already had people that I was considering for the board position job. I told them that if they showed up to more meetings and events, I could consider making them another board member, but with the current situation that I didn’t think it would be fair to make them a board member. They told me okay and that was that. However, today I was told by my friend group that my friend is actually mad at me for not giving them the board position. They claim that as a junior, they have more seniority than the freshman member, so they should be given more consideration. Also, they complained that it would lower their chances of getting into college because they couldn’t add it to their transcript. As a junior myself, I know how important activities are in order to apply to colleges. However, I cannot, in good conscience, just give them a club position that they didn’t earn. Some of my friends are taking their side and saying I should just give them the position. Others are saying they can “see both sides.” Am I the asshole for denying her a board member position?

I told her that I understand but she should think about it logically, and said that it would put a big damper on our day, especially from her perspective, since her family would be absolutely horrified and definitely make a stink the whole time. My fiancé got upset and accused me of being on their side, when in actuality I just want to avoid as much conflict as possible. AITA?

ETA: I guess she wants to show the tattoos at her wedding and not before bc she thinks it’s the best way to express herself?? I think she wants to really show off her tattoos for the first time to everyone on her big day","1580269251.0","No A-holes here","6","160"

Basically, certain sounds with food give me straight up anxiety. My SO and I were eating dinner tonight and just talking about our days. It was pasta and the sound of the slippery noodles was so bad I couldn't stand it. Usually it's fine, but this time it was really bad and I was feeling super anxious. 

She had told me something and I had given a less than fully interested response and she got annoyed. I asked what's wrong and she said that I seemed uninterested in her story. I told her that I was sorry but I felt super distracted by the sound of her eating the noodles and it was giving me a lot of anxiety. She was not happy and started crying and telling me that it's super hurtful to hear that, which I understand but I was just being honest as to why I was distracted. I do get that it does come off kind of like a personal attack but it's really only about the noise and it could be anyone.

I moved across the country with her to be closer to my kids (and consequently my exwife). I get the kids pretty regularly and intermittently throughout the week and quite like my schedule. Now, I quite enjoy being able to pick my kids up from school and go straight home (10-15 min away) to put them down for nap and dinner. My side is that even though I hate living where we live, and the town, I refuse to move greater than 30 min away from my kids. Her side is that if we move we can move around work days, start times, wake up early to drive the kids those several hours to school, and still maintain the agreed custody agreement. Obviously her parents agree with her as well as a few others, while my parents side with me. I am torn, because she moved so far with me, and I'm digging my heels in over a few hour drive.

I'm 22M dating a 26F. I had a crush on her for a while, she's really pretty and funny, and we get along great. About a month after we get together, her dad gets diagnosed with cancer. 


I have no frame of reference for dealing with sick people. I have never met her dad, and we are newly dating. About 5 months in, her dad gets pretty sick. During that time, she asks me if I want to meet her dad, and I tell her no, because I think it's way too soon. 


We're together for 6 and a half months when her dad dies. Naturally, she's a wreck. She's looking to me for support, but we've only been together for a short period of time. I don't want to help her plan a funeral and talk to family members I've member met before. 


I told her that I'll check in on her while she's planning, but I won't stay with her or help her plan. I also remind her that she has lots of friends who have known her longer than me who are really supportive. She says she is disappointed, but understands, and is fine as long as I come to the funeral. 


The day of the funeral comes, and, I just can't do it. I'm in my car, in my suit, and I just can't go in. My phone is blowing up from texts from her, texts from our friends, phone calls, and I just can't do it. I wind up not showing up. 


We talk later that night. She is really upset and says she can't believe she had to go through the whole event without my support and worrying about where I was the whole time. I felt bad, but reminded her again that we haven't been together for that long, and she had her brother and friends there. 


She calls me an asshole and tells me she needs time to think. It's been about a week now and I haven't heard from her. I think both of these decisions are rash. I don't think I'm an asshole, I just think I'm young and don't know how to deal with death.

Since he cooks so much at work he doesn’t often cook at home. This week however he felt inspired to cook so asked my mom if he could try making a dish for everyone tonight. 

He made this lamb dish with roasted potatoes and other vegetables and it was really good and he plated it up all nice before serving but he let the plates sit out for a while on the counter before serving. I think as a chef he’s used to just plating a dish at his restaurant he works at and having a waiter take it away hot to the table very soon after. That didn’t happen because after he plated them up he was doing something else and then a bit of cleaning so after only a couple minutes of eating the dishes were getting cold.

I went to microwave mine for a bit to warm it back up. When I came back to the table my brother looked pretty pissed off. He asked if something was wrong with dinner.

"evh6fc","1580269146","AITA for making my wife quit pot with me?","We've been together 12 years and smoking 5. 2 to 3 oz/mo between us. We've always paid our bills and gone to work.
I had problems when our daughter was born. At first we made the rule ""never while she's awake,"" but that turned into us smoking while she napped to us throwing the tv on and going out as soon as we got home from work.
Even when high, we're good parents, we're engaging, do fun activities and cook healthy meals but at 3, I don't want her first memory of us to be going out for a ""talk"" while she watches tv. 
There's also the financials. When she was born we had savings, but during my wife's maternity leave, we didn't change our lifestyle and savings vanished. Shortly before her leave ended, her father was diagnosed with cancer and she stayed off for an additional 7 months to care for him. This put us in a considerable debt that we haven't been able to cut down in over a year.
The new baby, the death of her father, finding a new job, and a move put a serious strain on our marriage. We had to go to counseling, but have rebounded through last year. We've been house shopping and want to buy one this year. We have a small down payment locked away but I know we need to clear the debt to get a mortgage. The fact that we spent $300-$500/mo is enough for me to quit.
I sat her down and told her I need help. I want it out of the house. I don't see a problem going out and smoking occasionally, but there's no reason to do it daily. She was adamant she didn't have a problem and wanted to keep smoking daily, but said she would hide it from me and the kid. In the past we've tried multiple times to take time off or to place a budget on it, but always failed after one of us got a migraine, had a bad day at work, etc. Eventually it always got back to 7 days a week, 3+ times a day.
It's a constant struggle for me. She'd hide the weed, but not well and I'd find it when cleaning. 
Last night we argued when she told me she's only spent $65 In 2 weeks on it, then said she was going out for a puff before hanging with me. I got upset and told her how I felt and she said she supported me, but didn't want to change her lifestyle. That I was being controlling. She told me to keep her out of my problem, that I should talk to someone and deal with it on my own.
As much as it is my problem, I also believe she's an addict in denial. She's never been more than 1 or 2 days sober -pregnancy notwithstanding- and she won't go without on my behalf. Im also concerned about resentment for both of us. Our marriage is finally in a good place after 2 years and this lack of control we're both feeling is threatening to put us back on the rocks. I want to quit for her and for our daughter. I don't want this debt on our heads. I want to buy the house we always wanted. It'd be so much easier if I wasn't faced with the temptation daily.

"evhbhf","1580269820","AITA for wanting to get engaged after graduation?","Crosspost from AITB just to get some more feedback. Thanks. 

My boyfriend and I (24M/F) have been dating for 2 1/2 years. He's absolutely perfect, has a steady job that he loves, his family is full of the sweetest people on Earth, and I genuinely feel happy with him. I feel like a new person with a new lease on life whenever I get to spend time with him or even see him, and his family has embraced me as one of their own. 

He means so much to me that I was the one who introduced the idea of us getting engaged. I know for a fact that I want to spend the rest of my life with him, even with my own life a bit less ""secure"". His answer was that he would want to wait until we were both in an equally stable footing in life before popping the question. This makes sense, and I'm not belittling his decision in any way. 

As for me, I'm in my last semester of a Master's program, haven't worked full-time yet. No stable income. My (single) mom flip-flops between a religious nut and a vindictive shrew, and I understand that my combination of financial and family issues would be off-putting to marry into. I wish I could save him from that immediately, but it's something I'm still dealing with. 

I get it. I don't want to marry him just to make it look like I'm only married to ""trade up"" my life or that I'm a golddigger or something horrible. Especially without working for myself, earning my own money, deciding on a house or a car for myself. 

The only reason I want to get engaged after I finally leave school is because I want to be engaged to him, period; I think he's a wonderful guy and promising myself to him in this way feels really special to me. Honestly, I specified doing so after graduation so I'm not too stressed with school anymore and we can just relax and enjoy being betrothed. Additionally, I tried to state that we wouldn't have to get married immediately, or in the next year, 5 years or 10, it would be on our timetable. 

(But there's another argument about the timetable- I take the stance that if we feel this strongly about one another, what's the point in waiting to get engaged? He, of course and understandably, continues to mention the above.)

Since first bringing it up a few months ago, we've talked about it no less than 5 times. Our stances are more or less the same, so maybe I should just call it and give up for now. That being said, we've asked our respective parents for their blessings: my mom was completely (surprisingly) on board and excited. His parents were on his side and more reluctant. 

But I can't help but feel bad for bringing it up, as if that's another ""responsibility"" he has to take on and not something organic and effortless. Not to mention that I'm not sure if my ""lower station"" in life even affords me the opportunity to be engaged. That's a rough sentiment to hold on to and label myself with, but there it is.

It never really bothered me, in fact I found it kind of endearing and I’ve bought several of them for her. A couple of years ago, she found one that she REALLY liked, a pig wearing pajamas, about a foot tall, and she began bringing it with her when we traveled, taking pictures of it in front of landmarks etc. to post to social media.

She got a few looks from people, presumably because she’s a grown ass woman carrying a stuffy with her, but I never thought much of it, that was her jam.

However, not long after, she started bringing it to restaurants with us, sometimes even asking if it could have its own chair. I thought this was a bit silly but it wasn’t hurting anyone so I didn’t say anything. Then, one time we were out for happy hour drinks and oysters at a somewhat upscale place (Coast, for those familiar with Vancouver) and she brought the stuffy. I had a crazy day at work and was a bit tired, and I noticed quite a few people glancing in our direction. I was acutely aware of how this might look to others - white guy with younger Asian wife carrying a stuffy, and I became so self conscious of the looks that I had a hard time enjoying my time with my wife.

So, I asked her if she could sometimes maybe just leave the stuffy at home. She said ok, but after thinking about it for a couple of minutes she became very angry, shouted “why, do I embarrass you??!!” and stormed out of the place, which then became silent lol. When I got home she was still fuming and felt personally attacked by my request. I tried explaining myself but it basically ended by her saying she’d bring it anywhere she damn well pleased. I didn’t push it further because I didn’t think it was worth fighting over more, and didn’t bring it up again.

She’s since mostly gotten out of this phase, and I probably wouldn’t have said anything to her if I hadn’t been a bit tired and grumpy that day, but in this instance was I the AH for asking her to leave the stuffy at home sometimes?","False","Not the A-hole","3","366"

I'm mostly bored alone in my room, planning for things to do with my batchmates (in this case the people I thought of as friends). We've hung out a few times during the semester, mostly during labs and stuff where we would discuss answers and stuff. Though the worst part during the semester was the times I find out that these guys were hanging out, going to trips, parties and didn't invite me. Probably sounds childish at this point, but I've always wanted to be a part of something. Anyways, ever so often when I find out that they did that and told them about, they keep saying they'll call the next time. Same thing that's been happening during school, and undergrad. Funny enough, I've told them how I didn't enjoy my time in undergrad and high school, and felt that it was gonna to repeat once again. 

Now, back to the summer break, I'm planning a few things we could considerably do during the summer  break. Every time I message them, it's the usual ""Sure dude, but not this time. Maybe later"" or ""Hmm, maybe. Is XYZ coming?"" etc. So naturally no plan of my actually happened. 

So a few days ago, I notice  that some of these ""friends"" are in a trip individually (i.e, their IG story shows that they're at a trekking spot, the usual generic landscape shot of a cool background). At first, I thought they were separate trips,probably sharing it now cause #throwback or something like that, and didn't want to get annoyed right away. 

A day later, I see one of them post a pic of all of them together on IG. Thinking of all the times this kept happening to me during my school and undergrad, and knowing that these guys left me out several times too; I WAS PISSED. At this point, I felt like I was used, just as always. So after a few pints, I started messaging some of them, about how scummy they are. And today, seeing if I got any response from them, I realise I was blocked by those guys I messaged.

This was a first to me. Being blocked that is. And for some reason, I'm having mixed feelings about it. Somewhat really angry, that there is no resolution to this, and somewhat sad, because these are the few people I know here, and thought I knew really well (Cause international student jitters).

She is never left with money or food (although sometimes she has a smoothie) and all she does is follow other customers around, standing uncomfortably close to them. I have received dozens of complaints that while they feel sorry for her it does make people for a little uncomfortable. I often offer her a free game (I work in a games store) or a lollipop etc, but she gets distressed when anyone tries to communicate with her so I tend not to anymore. My co-worker and I decided to call security, as this is what we’ve been told to do for any unattended child. They were shocked, one going as far as saying we should alert child services. 

HOWEVER, I sent a message to my boss to let him know, and he lost it. He told me it was wrong to single her out as she is disabled and that would look bad. He said she’s not hurting anyone so why should she be kicked out? My one and only issue is that she’s an unattended child, I would call security to alert them about any kid that’s unattended, handicapped or not.

Okay so my neighbor is a cool dude 99% of the time but it seriously bums me out that he leaves his dog cooped up inside his apartment for 23.5 hours out of the day (the dog: 100lb boxer). When he first moved in I offered to let his dog out on occasion while he was at work (I work from home so it's not a huge deal for me to cruise over for a few minutes to let him out, but it slowly morphed into him asking me to let him out while he goes out of town on the weekend.

Here's my dilemma: I am not the kind of dog owner that will leave my dog for more than 6 hours. Just won't do it. If I have to be gone for an extended period of time I make arrangements to have someone come stay with him and would never in 100 years leave him alone overnight. When I've been unable to find someone I trust, I'll skip the trip and chalk it up to being a dog owner and will try to plan better next time.

The first weekend I agreed to this arrangement my neighbor asked if I could feed the dog in the AM, let him out into a small front yard to pee, then let him out a few more times before bed. FOR THREE DAYS. Being the weak big hearted bastard that I am, I'm plagued with guilt every time that beautiful dog looks at me with sad eyes pleading for me not to leave him alone again. This literally happens 3-4 times each fucking day and when I leave him at the night it's the worst. My neighbor has a front window where the dog is perched all day and he's sitting there every time I walk by with his eyes pleading for me to come rescue him. If you haven't gathered by now, this makes my fucking heart bleed.

So yesterday he sends me this message: ""Are you gonna be around this weekend? My normal dog sitter isn’t available and I’m looking for someone to let my dog out Fri, Sat, and Sun morning. I’ll hook you up with a big bottle of whiskey, a big jar of weed, or $ if you are. If not, no biggie, just don’t like having a stranger come in my house""

(His dog sitter is someone who comes to his house for 30 min in the morning and 30 min late at night to feed him and let him out to pee.)

I respond: ""Sorry dude, can’t do it. It stresses me out too much locking him up in that place for 23.5 hours and I feel guilty whenever I see him looking out the window. I don’t think dogs are meant to sit in one spot that long. It would be rad if you could find a cool place for him to stay where he could have a little fun and have something to do. I know I could’ve just said no and left it at that but I respect our friendship too much not to level with you.""

"ewckz1","1580419488","WIBTA if I forced my roommate's girlfriend to pay rent every month?","Hi all,

So I'll try to keep it reasonably short.

I'm (M20) currently a 3rd-year University student in a small off-campus apartment with 2 other roommates who we'll call Dave (M20) and Steve (M24). We each have our own room and a small common area/kitchen. We're all on separate lease agreements, paying $680/month all utilities, parking included. 

One of my roommates, Dave, has been dating a girl since September of this school year (Sarah F18), whom Steve and I really do not enjoy, though we respect her and coexist. ***Last semester after only a week of dating, she would stay at our apartment 6-7 days of the week, for 3 weeks in a row with absolutely zero consent from Steve and I - nor does she make any form of contribution in cleaning, cooking, or rent.***

So back in October we sat down Dave and said okay, you're not respecting our boundaries here, and while we don't want to restrict you seeing her, we would prefer she stay no more than 3 nights a week. Dave seemed very receptive in conversation...but his behavior does not change all the way through December (I was too busy with school to make this a worry). Also just note our lease doesn't allow SO to move in without being on a separate lease.

***He completely ignored any compromise we set, and I now fear I must put my foot down.*** So here we are in February, and Dave decides to (or failed out, we don't know) take a semester off of school. Two weeks into the semester, Dave doesn't have a job and his girlfriend stays here all day and all night; they smoke weed in the apartment without even opening a window and playing video games through all hours of the night (just to set the tone of the attitude we're dealing with).

Listen, I'm aware I'm not Dave's father here, but Steve and I are both STEM majors and have quite a bit of homework to do, and seeing Sarah on my couch every single day starts to wear at me. My home is truly one of the only places I can unwind, and she's taking that away from me.

My current proposal draft: She stays no more than 3 nights a week, every week. If more, she can pay $340 to Steve and I (split) in addition to Dave's rent. WIBTA?  

If not, knowing our rent, what would be a fair amount (to not be an asshole) for her to pay up?

A couple years ago they rescued a female dog off the streets and never spayed her, several months later a male came along, and they didn’t fix him either. Thinking they could just keep them separated during the females heat cycle they just left things as they were. 

Of course that didn’t work out and they had puppies. Since then things have just completely spiraled. They now have 20+ dogs on this property and they themselves are struggling with health issues and are in and out of the hospital. 

We’ve looked in to shelters and rescues in the area and unfortunately all of them have surrender fees that my parents just could NOT afford for all the dogs. 

I know it sounds like an easy choice to make this decision, if my mom were to find out she’d be devastated. They care more for these dogs than they do for themselves (which is one of the biggest issues we have) and they don’t seem to understand that this environment isn’t healthy for them OR the dogs.

Two of her kids have ADHD and two of them have autism. For the past few months two of them (the eldest (12) who doesn’t have a disorder and the youngest (5)) have been entering my yard to steal eggs from my chickens. The younger child even tried to TAKE one of the chickens as a pet. Not only are they harassing and traumatising my chickens, I’m worried they’re going to harm themselves in my yard which certainly isn’t childproof or they’ll climb into the separate part of my yard where my dogs are, who may get protective and attack. I added extra height to that side of the fence to prevent them climbing over it. They then climbed the gate.. I have tried putting locks and chains on the gate. They pulled off the chain and broke it, and ignore the lock and just climb over. I’ve tried speaking to the mother but she claims her two autistic kids require her 24/7 care so she can’t keep an eye on all of them, and ‘kids will be kids’. She does not seem to care what her kids are doing or where they are. I don’t care about the eggs, I even offered to give them eggs weekly so they don’t have to get their own. But they still come in even when I do give them eggs. 


So after months of this happening and getting nowhere with the mother, it happened again yesterday. I called the police. They came and removed the children from my yard and gave them, as well as the mother, a stern talking to. Later that day the mother came over in tears and asked me how I could be so awful to a struggling single mum of disabled kids. She told me I have no idea how hard it is for her (maybe stop having kids then) and that I was completely out of line for traumatising her children like that. But something had to be done before those kids get injured in my yard. Our neighbour across the street saw everything go down and even they approached me to say I shouldn’t have called the police. He suggested I just sit in the yard and supervise the kids... they’re not my responsibility! I’m also not home 24/7!  What would you have done in this situation? AITA?

"ewd1u2","1580421239","AITA for saving a litter of puppies?","I got a puppy from a family last year. It wasn't a breeder, or at least I don't think so? They have working dogs on their farm and sometimes the female has puppies which they then care for to sell or keep to have more working animals. If this is a way to supplant their income, I don't know, that's the situation though.

They had a new litter this month and sent out a mass e-mail to all those who adopted from them saying that their farm is facing hard times and will likely not be able to care for the current pups (a litter of 7). They implored any interested parties to come adopt them for free, because they can't take care of them.

The thing is that *I know* they have euthanized puppies or left them to nature before. They said it's part of life on their farm and they've done it before for runts who don't latch or whatever other reasons. It's normal to them, despite how horrendous it really is.

I had an exchange with the family because I like to keep in touch and they told me no one has shown interest and they'll have to ""get rid of the puppies some way or another"". I decided to adopt them right then and there, to save my own dog's siblings.

Right now I'm raising them until they're the requisite 8 weeks old and then finding new homes for them. They're all 3 weeks old. It is tough, gruelling, and oftentimes disgusting work. I've never even done this before in my life even with one puppy let alone seven while maintaining my own two dogs.

Why might I be the asshole? My girlfriend is royally POed that I did this despite her protests. She explicitly and clearly said no when I ran it by her, but my heartstrungs were plucked too hard, I couldn't resist. She might turn around when they're older and less gross, because she loves the puppy we got last year. Plus maybe in the future I can sell them like the farmer would have. They were $850 a pup, I can probably swing around that, too, make very good money.

I just don't know if this was noble of me or assholish of me, to go against my girlfriend to literally save seven dog lives.

It's been OK. I do feel like I have to be twice as hardworking / productive / competent to get the respect I do. But since I do work very hard it's OK.

There are small issues that make being female hard here. For example the office temperature ranges from 63F to 59F. Every one of them is a sizable man and that's the temp they're comfortable at. I'm petite and wear my coat, hat and fingerless gloves all day. As a ""compromise"" I can have a space heater at my desk, but as it's open plan, this doesn't do much.

The women's bathroom has a tiny sitting area, and I put another heater there, so I can sit there for a bit and warm up if I have to, which helps.

In October an engineer started transitioning to a woman - ""Alan"" to ""Chloe."" Alan had hardly ever talked to me, but my first encounter with her as Chloe was stressful. She started using the women's bathroom and said my heater had to go since she had to do her makeup and it was making her sweat and her makeup run. I said let's discuss it, try to find a compromise, but after I came back from lunch I found the heater unplugged on my desk. I went to ask her what happened, she harshly said the bathroom wasn't my private property and I ""needed to start learning to consider others for once in my life."" This was basically my first conversation with this person ever!

I thought we'd just avoid each other after that but she actually started acting like we were BFFs. ""Us girls"" this, and ""us girls"" that. Whenever I go to the bathroom she'd book it there to start talking to me while I was using the stall, about topics I have no interest in like makeup and clothes. 

She assumed I'm interested in things like gossip and catty remarks about others which I AM NOT. I'm a very positive team oriented person and don't like talking about others behind their back.

Chloe started acting like she's ditzy / helpless and can't do things that SHE WROTE TRAINING MANUALS ON OVER 10 YEARS AGO. And say things to me in front of the whole office like, ""it's just so hard for us girls!"" 

After a few times I asked Chloe to stop acting like women aren't competent, and I haven't heard her do it in a little while.

But she ramped up the other stuff, like saying ""us girls"" to the other engineers, making BOTH of us different from them. Wanting to talk to me about ""girlie"" topics I dislike. She brings them up at normal social times like lunch so I can't always say I'm busy.

I DO NOT WANT her separating me from the other engineers based on my sex. I had to fight hard enough to be seen as just another engineer and respected. I don't want to be put in a different box. I don't want to be ""one of the girls"" with her and separated from the others. I don't want these constant gender reminders referenced to me. I also don't like her as Alan or Chloe and don't want to be friends.","False","Not the A-hole","8","684"

"ewdee5","1580422534","WIBTA if I reported my boss to the labor union, even if it would ruin his family's life?","I've been struggling with this for a while now, but something recently occurred that pushed me to make this post. I work for a Chinese restaurant in my college town, and it's a pretty popular, family-owned place. I'm one of the few college students who work there, mostly so I can answer the phone for orders and relay it to the rest of the staff easier than customers, because the rest of the staff is mostly made of immigrants, with English being a second language of some. 

When my first paycheck came out, I noticed that it was dated for a few days later than that day. I went to deposit it into my bank account and discovered that my bank would not accept it. A little irritated, I returned to the restaurant to ask what was going on. After some stubborn negotiation, the owner begrudgingly accepted to take my check and give me cash instead. I thanked him, however, it bothered me that it bothered him so much, as he gives cash to all the waiters and kitchen staff. On my next shift, I asked one of my other coworkers about the checks, and she said that it was ""how it is"", and she waits the extra days until she can cash her check. She doesn't want to push an issue when she would be getting paid anyway, as I found out when the owner did not take my proposal kindly.

Fast forward to yesterday, and it is once again payday. I have this day off, a trend that I had noticed over time, that i would not be working on paydays. (I had tried to cash out a few other times, which did not go over well, before finding out that I could deposit it online, even if it would take some time for that as well). So I went in to the restaurant and see my boss. He sees me, and this follows:

Owner: ""No! You can't cash it out!""

Me: ""Oh, I know. I was just wondering if I could pick it up?

Owner: ""Oh, ok. No, no, no, I didn't call-"" He begins stammering, before bluntly stating, ""They're not ready.""

I say ok and leave. This time, I felt slighted not only because I felt he was so rude, but because I had been working a lot, helped him draft a letter disputing a credit card claim, and told him how to prepare for his insurance hearing. He got into a car accident and told me he was drunk. I worked for them through the holidays, not being able to see my family on Christmas or New Years. I worked on Chinese New Year, which was insane. 

However, I feel conflicted because if I were to report them to the labor board, they would investigate and almost certainly the owners would lose the restaurant, and worst case everyone would lose their jobs. The owners have two young kids, and I don't want them to have to struggle, but they are being so unprofessional and honestly hurting me when I feel I have put in a lot of work for them.

Last year one of my close family friends “M” graduated and had quit her part time job in the exam season prior, she also informed the family who she babysat for for a good few years that she would no longer be doing it. Nobody was sure why she cut off all her working opportunities as she was about to graduate and didn’t have a graduate job lined up, jobs are few and far between in her line of work. At a family gathering, she told me she had stopped babysitting, and told me they’re now looking for someone. I jumped at this chance, so she gave me their number and told them lots of good things about me as I’ve babysat lots in the past. Her brother (D) heard this interaction and asked me what I was doing, and that M babysits for them and it earns her good money. M explained she wants to stop but gave no particular reason. Her mother (T) then gets involved and says she shouldn’t be quitting this with nothing else lined up and how was she going to contribute to the household etc. Then T and D take me aside and ask me to try to get M to reconsider (bearing in mind she had quit her other job). I wasn’t keen as I’m not gonna pressure my friend, plus they’re asking me to give up a work opportunity that I’ve just been offered. This wasn’t an argument situation, just a chat, no bad blood. It was left at that and I went on to be asked to babysit three times in the space of two weeks. Around this time, T was at my house and I told her about how much I’d been babysitting, she seemed a bit pissed at me. She also suggested that M had been saying she wanted it back and that it was unfair that I’m taking literally every shift they offer me as it was her who led me to them. M denied this when I asked her about it. Another thing T said was that I should “at the very least” be filtering some of the work through to M. Which I point blank refused, if the family text me, they’re asking for me and it would be inappropriate for me to say “M can do it” if it’s ME they’re asking!

This is great supplementary income on top of what I already earn with my part time job and side projects. I don’t *need* this extra income as my parents are so kind as to provide for me through my uni years. But I’m always looking to earn extra. I really think she needed the money from this more than me.

We decided that it was best at the time for she and our son to go and stay with her dad in the Northeast while I remained in the South where we lived and got things together. 

Two more months passed and I finally got an offer at for a very good job and I moved to get us a new apartment. By the time I was able to get things stable enough to bring my wife and son home, she’d met someone else and told me she would be pursuing a relationship with him and not coming home. 

Since then I have continued to work this new job and really get my life together. I’ve traveled up to where she is multiple times and even bought her a plane ticket to come here. I’ve paid for both of their insurance and all of his daycare. Basically everything that I could be doing given the 1,300 miles between my child and I.

Given the distance I have done everything I can to be perfect. I call and FaceTime nearly every single day. I travel as often as I can. I give her all of the money she asks for.

Am I really the asshole for pursuing my own dream instead of following her to where she and my son are currently?


Edit: For clarification, my divorce lawyer has indicated that my custody rights should not be affected by the move. I will be entitled to the same “long distance parenting plan” whether I am here or in Alaska","1580424375.0","Everyone Sucks","3","38"

My mom always tries to snap pics of me and if I refuse we get into arguments over it. I gained a bit of weight lately because of depression and my mom took a picture of me and later sent it to me with an older skinnier picture of mine saying I have Cushings disease and should go see a doctor. I am familiar with what the disease is and know that I don’t have any symptoms other than weight gain (my face gets rounder) and told her so but she insisted and got mad when I didn’t see a dr. This was like a year ago but hurt pretty bad and after that I refused to allow my pics to be taken. Well last week was my 30th birthday and i agreed to take a pic after my mom promised that she won’t send it to anyone, it’s a big date after all. Later in the day she was showing me something on her Facebook and I saw right away that she had posted that picture with a caption along the lines of “happy birthday to my daughter” and it already had like 50 likes on it so people definitely saw it. I lost it and yelled at her saying she broke her promise and such but she said I am being selfish and she wants people to know that she has a daughter since there are never any pictures of me and it is also a big day for her since she is my mother. It’s been on my mind all week since my mom didn’t do anything that a normal person would think is bad, it’s just me and my broken brain and I feel bad.

We split up early 2019, two weeks from being married. We fought a lot and there were a lot of mistakes made on both our parts, mostly mine.

Just before Christmas she got back in touch with me and we've been talking and flirting and have even met up a few times and it felt like maybe we were heading in the direction of getting back together.

And then two weeks ago, out of nowhere she just stops talking to me. After I messaged her a few times asking if she was okay and if she wanted me to give her some space she finally messaged me back ranting that I was treating her like a child and how I can do whatever I want to. We have yet to speak since then.

During our time together, my ex was really clingy, she had issues with people leaving her and she would beg me to never leave.

I know that if I give her more time she will start speaking to me again and things will be good but then it will stop and it's just a cycle I'm not willing to go through right now.

They asked to borrow €15 during the week and said they'd pay me back when they got paid. Its another two weeks until they get paid at this point, they're obviously broke. I said yes under the condition that we make the budget. My thinking here was the whole give a man a fish/ teach a man to fish thing. 

So at first it's a yes. But then they became really defensive saying that it won't work, that they've done one already, insisting that it doesn't need to be done until after they get paid etc. Basically finding every excuse under the sun to avoid it or delay it.

Four days after that talk I reminded them about it and they sent me their 'budget'. It didn't have any bills, subscriptions anything on it. It was incredibly basic. I asked where the bills etc were. Their response was that they don't know how much they cost, they just come out of the bank. I explained that you need to know what you're spending in order to keep track of expenses and told them to look back through emails/ the bank account to find them and they got defensive again and stopped replying. 

I text again later on asking if they wanted to meet up and get it done and they refused to saying they were tired. I asked when they wanted to meet up if they weren't going to do it today. They suggested we do it on a bus on the way to an event during the weekend. They had suggested it earlier on in the week and I had already said it wasn't practical to do it on the bus. I told them again and they said they weren't doing it otherwise. I reminded them that I was lending them money on the condition that they made the budget. They then said they got money from someone else and that I don't need to worry about it anymore.

AITA? I felt like I was right at first but I'm beginning to doubt it now. They made me feel shit. I know it's not a lot of money and we both know I can afford to spare it. But that wasn't the point to me. I wanted to teach them a life skill in hopes they wouldn't be stuck again in the future. 

I was probably a bit harsh and feel like shit for holding the money over their head like that. But I honestly thought I was doing the right thing.

We moved into a house that is a 20 minute drive from our place of work, with ample public transport but it takes around 45 mins. 2 of the housemates cannot drive, one was in the process of buying one and I had a car.

About 6 weeks before we all move in together, my daily runabout car was stolen. The insurance payout was fairly small and wouldn't have gotten me a replacement in similar condition due to how much work I had done to get it running. 

Instead I used the money to 'complete' my project car with the intention to just daily it. It's my pride and joy and I love it immensely knowing how much work its taken. Not to mention its a hoot to drive. 

We move in to the house the weekend before we are due to start work. It turns out that the housemate who was going to buy a car decided that he would rather have a holiday instead so just never bought one. So it was only me with my own transport. 

The conversation then turns to how am I going to get everyone to work on Monday. We never discussed travel arrangements 

This was the problem. My car doesn't have rear seats.
Someone welded a roll cage in there and I never found matching rear seats so I just left it.
That meant there is only room for me and 1 passenger.

They're freaking out at me asking how I could be so irresponsible to have such an impractical car. I had to sell it immediately and buy something they could all get in to work in.

They ranted and raved and I even found one of them had PUT MY CAR ON FB marketplace! To 'help me flip it' for about 2/3 of what it was worth

So for the last 3 months, every morning 2 of them get up super early to get the bus to work, and someone gets to come in my car. Theyre all pissed at me.

I’m currently sitting in my vets office as they are closing, still waiting for the vet to talk with me.  Earlier this week my dog was diagnosed with a very aggressive and painful form of cancer.  My mother in law was watching our dog and became concerned when she started limping for no apparent reason.  My wife and I were on vacation at the time.  

Tuesday morning the vet called my MIL and left a voicemail she couldn’t understand, so she called back and was given the bad news.  When we returned home that night she shared what she was told, but couldn’t give us details.  She told the vet the situation and that my wife and I would be calling in the morning.  

Wednesday morning we make the call- but the vet isn’t in.  Further, he didn’t leave detailed notes for the vet on call, so we weren’t able to get any information about the diagnosis.  Meanwhile me dog has been whining, panting, and is in obvious distress.  We have minor pain medication for her arthritis, but it’s clearly not enough.  

Understandably I was very frustrated and called back again this morning, since the vet was going to be.  I called when they opened and was told he’d return my call.  4 calls later over the course of the day and I’ve gotten nowhere.  I’ve told everyone I’ve spoken to that my dog is in obvious pain and needs medication, at the least, yet I keep getting told to wait.  I kept getting told he’d call me within an hour.  

Frustrated and 40 minutes to closing I hoped in my car and drove to the office.  I told the vet techs I’m the person who’s been calling all day and that I just need the vet to give me 5 minutes. They told me to sit down and wait until he’s free.  I don’t feel like I’ve been rude, and aside from desperate and frustrated, Im being respectful with them.  Meanwhile I can hear the vet techs bitching, calling me confrontational, and claiming I’m trying to intimidate them.  

I’m at my wits end.  This dog means the world to me and was there for me when I went through some of the toughest times in my life.  I just don’t want her to suffer and for the life of me I can’t understand why they’re treating this like a trivial issue.

UPDATE:  I’m out of the office.  I got to have a long sit-down with the vet, who is new at the office and I’d never met.  He was extremely apologetic and took complete responsibility.  He said he knew it was going to be a difficult call and kept waiting for a calm moment so we could talk.  He told me he understands if I decide to switch offices.  I’m still angry, but right now I care more about my dog.  

Unfortunately the diagnosis is terminal and my dogs not a candidate for surgical intervention. She’s older and has had a great life, so I called my wife and we decided the kindest thing would be to put our little girl to sleep.  We have an appointment first thing in the morning and we’ve been given some strong pain killers that will keep her comfortable and sleepy until then.

"ewe6xi","1580425501","AITA for calling the cops on skateboarders?","Standard warning- on my mobile

Each of my brothers has a different opinion on my actions, so I’m wondering AITA?

Down the street from my apartment is a busy downtown intersection. One corner is taken up by a massive construction project and the sidewalk around it is completely blocked off with a walkway made from a blocked off traffic lane, concrete barriers, metal pipe fencing, and an awning. 

For several weekends in a row a group of skateboarders had been hanging at that corner with one of them constantly trying (and failing) to do a trick off the series of barriers like its an obstacle course while another filmed him. The failing part matters because he kept falling off, usually into the road. They would be there for hours. At night. And the corner is a no right turn on red because there is very little visibility around that corner- the corner the guy kept trying to skate around. They would wait until the walk sign would turn on for the direction the “trick” started in, but the path took the skater around the corner, though not inherently into moving traffic. 

That said, I watched as the skater and the cameraman blocked both car and pedestrian traffic. I watched him fall in front of cars who had to slam on their brakes. I didn’t just watch, I stopped each time and told them that what they were doing was dangerous and illegal and that they needed to stop. In my presence, other pedestrians ignored them or cursed at them. One guy yelled at them, calling them “organ donors”. So I wasn’t the only one concerned and/or annoyed. The skater ‘s response was that we just didn’t understand. That the guy [trying] to do the trick was going to be famous on YouTube [someday]. 

After the third weekend of this I was walking home across the street when I saw my neighbor approaching the intersection. I live in an 80/20 building and my neighbor is both mentally handicapped and in a motorized wheelchair. He asked the skaters to move so he could cross the street but the skaters ignored him and blocked all of the footpath. He could have maneuvered through if he was walking . . . but wheelchair. He was forced to drive into the street with cars to get to the bus stop. 

That was it for me. I called the cops on the skaters. The cops came, but didn’t arrest anyone, and the skaters haven’t been back since. 

Brother A says I’m NTA but I am the old woman shaking my cane and telling the kids to get off my lawn. Brother B said I massively overreacted and that IATA. Brother C asked if the skaters were POC’s because then calling the cops might have disproportionate consequences (unfair but true), as they were Whitey McWhitersons, he says I was reasonable and am NTA. 

So, AITA? Did I overreact to an urban annoyance or were the skaters the ones who crossed the line?

Edit: to respond to an info, the skaters had blocked me three times and the guy trying the trick almost ran into me once. He didn’t miss. I dodged. When I asked them to stop, every time they were actively in my way.","1580427582.0","Not the A-hole","6","28"

So a little more than a year ago, my best friend's girlfriend broke up with him. He was devastated by it and I really felt for him. I tried to support him as well as I could. I went to his house frequently, I called him almost every day and I would comfort him at school as well (that is, when he would go to school). He skipped school a lot during the first period after his breakup and I think that it was understandable. Then, summer passed and I didn' t see him much, but after the summer he still wasn't over her. We're in our last year of secondary school in Holland right now and soon we will be taking exams. His marks aren't great and I'm worried that he won't pass the exams. He still calls in sick almost every week for one or several days. I texted him to check how he felt every time and tried to listen to whatever he needed to get off his chest. 

Last time, we were working on a project together and he promised me that he would come on the day of the presentation but he called in sick again so I had to do everything on my own. He sent me an apology text and said he wasn't feeling well. I sent him a text with ""get well soon"" without anything else. He immediately asked me if I was annoyed, because I usually keep the conversation going. I told him how I felt: I said that I understand that healing from a breakup takes time and (since I never had a serious relationship) I could never understand what he was going through. I also told him that he was letting himself and others down and that is never a good thing to do. I said that I had tried my best to help him but that there is nothing more I can do for him. I told him I was done listening to his issues, because he seemed to not care about mine. Now he's mad at me.

my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 5 months, and it’s been pretty smooth sailing. but we had one of our first genuine arguments over a ketchup packet that exploded in his room. 

his room is not the tidiest, but it’s certainly not all his fault. admittedly, at least half of the dishes/fast food food bags in his room are from when he and i are together so i’m equally responsible for causing the mess. on this particular night, a ketchup packet was on the ground (you know, the kind you usually get from a McDonalds or whatever) and i stepped on it. at first i didn’t know what had happened, it felt like i cracked a part of my foot/toe or something... but when i looked down i see “blood” on my foot/ground and it takes me another second to realize it was ketchup. luckily, his room is all hardwood floor.

in a kind of hysterical relief, i start laughing. i turn around to tell him what had happened, when he points up at the wall behind me, straight-faced, which i hadn’t seen yet. i slowly look up, and i kid you not, the ENTIRE length of the wall has ketchup splats on it. it looks like a murder scene. it even made it up part-way to the ceiling. at this point, i couldn’t believe such a small packet/incident made SUCH a mess.  

i was in shock of how ridiculous the scene was. after already laughing for about 20 seconds from the initial “splat”, i lost it when i saw the wall. i fell back on the bed and tears start flowing from my face from laughter. meanwhile, my boyfriend is staring at the wall/me and is annoyed with my reaction, or lack of reaction to the mess. i look at him, still laughing, and say “i’m sorry, it’s just so ridiculous” but his facial expression doesn’t budge. he says “okay, just please get up.” and i realize he’s frustrated. immediately i stop laughing and feel absolutely AWFUL for finding this funny, when he is renting from this house and will have to pay if the stains don’t come up from the wall. the mood shifts dramatically, and i get up to wash my foot off when i notice a sweater of his also took some damage from the damned condiment. i run to the bathroom with the sweater and frantically try getting the stains out (luckily they did all come out). i start apologizing and he says it’s okay, but i feel awful still.

he wasn’t frustrated about the sweater however, it was more about the walls/my lack of serious attitude about the incident. after talking about it a day later or so, his stance on the matter is “it wasn’t about the ketchup, it was that you were just laughing and not doing anything about it” and my stance is more or less “it was just so comedic i couldn’t help my reaction”. i did of course intend to help him clean up the mess, but i was trying to recover from the laughing fit i was in first. i apologized, and he apologized for getting mad at me. so reddit- AITA for laughing when i caused a mess in his room that potentially would cost him?","False","No A-holes here","3","19"

My mom (F/52yo) had an accident at work and broke her leg, the fracture was bad enough that she needed surgery. Thankfully the procedure went well and she’s home now. On top of that she was fighting a quite nasty cold when this happened so the Drs warned me that she had to remain in bed for a while until her lungs were ok again. My house is super cold, so I had to prepare a special room for her to control the temperature. 

Anyway, I’m an only child and she’s divorced. So I’m her only caretaker, and I’m not complaining about this. I love my mom dearly and taking care of her while she needs it is an honor for me because she’s done a lot for me and she deserves the best care I can give, but since I’m alone in this my days are pretty much all about making sure her needs are met, medicine, food cooking, cleaning after the both of us, etc. Heck, I even got an air mattress to sleep in the same room as her because she has trouble sleeping because of the pain and if she needs anything I want to be nearby because I won’t hear her from my room. I’m exhausted but I’m totally ok with this because I’m super thankful that she’s feeling better with each passing day. 

Here’s when the guests come into play. Friends, co-workers and family members think it’s totally ok to come to the house uninvited and unannounced to visit her. They do bring flowers and gifts, but there are days when I simply don’t even have the time to brush my teeth or change out of my pajamas. Or maybe I’m in the middle of cleaning her room and the doorbell rings. And I have to rush and have the place, my mom and I  decent enough to welcome them in and then make sure they’re comfortable too and bring them coffee or cookies. And I know I could just stop doing this and let them it with the house or us being a mess, but my mom would be embarrassed. 

I just realized how rude it is to visit a sick person whiteout letting them know in advance. At first I was gracious about it, now I’m just extremely annoyed. I don’t even smile at them anymore or try to join the conversation. And its obvious to them that I’m upset about their visit. But when they leave I feel super guilty because they’re trying to show my mom that they care about her too. 

I don’t even know what to think anymore.

"eweqtv","1580427566","AITA for giving my honest ratings on the attractiveness of each women at the party I was at?","We’re all around 20 years old here. My friend Johnny hosted a party last night at his place. There were like 12 people. 5 women. This took place late into the party with a few drinks in. I was one of the two guys there without a girlfriend. Some of the women there said I’m pretty hot and wanted me to rate all 5 of the women there. They think hot guys have a better eye for this. All the women agreed to it. They’re all in a relationship and 3 of them had their boyfriends with them. I don’t think I’m a Chad or anything and I also told them that I’m uncomfortable rating them because I know women get jealous easily and it’s my first time meeting 2 of them. The women, and later even the men, kept pressuring me. 


I thought what the heck and caved in. I told them my scale is from 0-10, mean of 5, and follows a normal distribution, so don’t get upset by a low-sounding score. Jennifer, who’s my friend, told me to shut up and just rate them. I started off from my left. I rated Tammy, who’s also my friend, a 6. Before I could go on, Tammy asked me why the fuck I rated her so low. I told her I’m not here to discuss that and hurt feelings, but rather to only dish out the numbers. The girls started laughing at Tammy. I told them again that 5 is the average and 6 is a standard deviation above. Jennifer told me to shut up again. I rated Rachel, who I met for the first time, a 7. Uproar ensued as Tammy got pissy. I then rapidfired my numbers at the end to end this quickly. I gave Jennifer an honest 5.5, Eileen, who’s new to me, an 8, and Carly, who’s my friend, a 7. 


They were all tripping out about my ratings and Jennifer was the pissiest of them all. She was the only one who kept attacking me and said I must be blind or purposefully rating her the lowest because  she was the one who pressured me the most into rating them. I told her that I’m dipping because I couldn’t handle so much cattiness in one place. I’ve been getting some flak from my friend Xavier for rating his girlfriend Jennifer the lowest because she’s been pissy all day. I told him that she wanted to play a stupid game and won a stupid prize. He wants me to apologize to Jennifer, but I told him that my opinion doesn’t matter and he’s the one who should treat her like a princess so she doesn’t go out seeking validation from other guys. Xavier said he couldn’t get through to her. I told him to give her some time and she’ll be fine and might even apologize to me for how she acted.

"ewewuj","1580428188","AITA for quitting my job without notice and leaving my boss ""in the lurch""?","Okay it sounds bad, but hear me out. 

So up until recently, I (F22) worked nights at a mid-up scale resturant. It was a decent job that I kept for two years, however in the last six months it has gone downhill. I had become increasingly unhappy with the treatment from my boss, the owner, and from the kitchen staff. I've ended more a few nights in tears, due to unnecessary fights and stress amongst the staff. 

In that time I also got a day job at a tapas bar. VERY different atmosphere, I'm happy when I come home from work and I also get paid a little more, like a dollar an hour. I was offered more hours by the tapas bar last year in December, but as it is the busiest time of year in hospitality I felt like I couldn't quit my first job until the end of the season (I am the most senior server believe it or not, and often act as a supervisor to the other servers, not paid accordingly of course.)

My first job closed for a month over January and just came back. During that time, I have been working more shifts at the tapas bar, and when they offered again to give me more hours. I accepted. As soon as I could I went into see my old boss and told him I was leaving.

Now here's where I may be the AH. He completely blew up and told me that I should've given him notice, now he was in the lurch and I've let him down etc. But you see, I am a casual worker and where I'm from that means you are not required to give notice, just as your employer is not required to give you notice when firing you.  I explained this to him and told him that I could've left during December but stuck it out for him. That he just opened for the year and would have no trouble finding someone to replace me. That I had been unhappy for a long time as part of the culture that he created. 
It didn't help, he just kept repeating that I had let him down etc, eventually I just left. 

When I told my friend about what happened, he agreed with my boss and told me that giving notice would've been the right thing to do even though it's not required and that I'm an AH. Now I feel guilty.

"ewf4fq","1580428965","WIBTA if I ask my father to come help out around the house before an inspection?","My partner and I have been living together for about 2 years now, and things are going mostly great- we have our ups and downs but we’re working through them and overall living together is awesome.

Context: I moved out of home when I was in my 20s, and due to my family's conservative views, I was briefly disowned as a result. My home life at my parents place was very complicated and sometimes toxic; I still strongly believe that long term, moving out was the best thing for me, and the best thing for my relationship with my parents. My family and I are working on our relationship, and things have been really great recently with them, which is amazing.

My partner does not like my family at all, mostly for the treatment that I received when living under their roof, and refuses to acknowledge them, despite my good relationship with them and the fact that I want them to be an active part of my life. He refuses to go to family events or talk to them at all, which has caused a strain on reconnecting (he has recently been uninvited from my sister’s wedding which caused an issue). I can understand his views as it comes from a place of concern for me, and I'm not trying to force him to be best friends with my parents, however his outright disdain for my parents is causing strain. My partner expects me to have a fantastic relationship with his parents, and consistently invites them over (This will become relevant in a moment).

My partner and I have an rental inspection scheduled for Monday, and thanks to my full on 6 day work schedule, there is a lot of work to be done that I haven’t gotten around to yet. We will be working tirelessly over the weekend, however there are a few things that we will struggle getting inspection ready- fixing a wardrobe door that fell off it's track, some carpentry stuff and the garden (I'm allergic to ants, and our entire area has a fire ant problem, so I can't go in my own back/front yard). My father is a pretty damn good carpenter and handyman- He did this for many years in the Navy. My grandfather was also a gardner and landscape designer professionally, and taught my father a lot about gardening. Long story short, we could save ourselves hundreds of dollars that we don't have, just by inviting my father over for a 2-3 hours to help out. My father is 100% down for this; he helped with my sister's inspection the other week and he honestly really gets a kick out of doing handywork.

My partner has refused to allow me to have my parents over in the past; he's not controlling in any way, but does put his foot down on this one thing. However, I know for a fact that we cannot get it all done ourselves this weekend, and we do need help. Obviously I'm going to talk to my partner before anything, and maybe offer that he doesn't have to be here when my father is, but WIBTA if I invited my father over to help out?

Edit 1: Forgot to mention by my father would 100% refuse payment for any help he gives, and only expects a coffee, toast and a hug in return; we're not trying to exploit him lol","1580430285.0","Not the A-hole","3","9"

My dad has his 40 year work anniversary party in April, which is a big thing in our country. My bf and I have known the party date for a year and a half now, and rsvp’d to go. 

My bf’s little brother got a new girlfriend in September, and they had a spontaneous wedding in November. The whole family was angry at them for keeping it a secret. 
Now they’ve decided that they want to have children, so they are having a wedding party to celebrate their marriage. They are having the wedding on the same date at my dad's party. 

My boyfriend really wants to go (of course) but I don’t think that’s fair since we already said yes to my father, and got that invite first. ( in our culture we say that the first thing you get invited to, is the thing you go to) 
I know my dad would be devastated if both or one of us cancel. 

We have argued about this and he thinks I’m a bit of an a-hole, for asking him to skip their wedding party.

"ewf8wo","1580429463","AITA for not wanting to join a free vacation with my family?","For context, I am one of the eldest cousins in a relatively big family. Recently my family decided to go on a trip in April of this year. Being one of the eldest, and having traveled with different groups of people in the family, I always get assigned to plan family trips. I have to compile where everyone wants to go, create the itinerary, and basically do the directing and assisting everyone in the trip. Every time we’re in a different country, I have to google maps everything and figure out how to fit the places they want to go to in the days we have on vacation whilst integrating the places I want to go to.

Prior to me graduating uni, we would always get private tours and though that cost more, it was actually easier and more convenient for me. I think collectively in the last 5 years since I graduated, we’ve travelled four times together, this one being the fifth (we would go on one big family trip a year). So unfortunately there are two problems with this situation. 1.) My family and I are very different in places and things we want to do. I love eating in nice places (and seeking them out) and taking a chill day to explore the city-culture, my family prefers to go to tourist spots and take tons of photos there and they don’t really care where we eat. 2.) I like spending time alone on trips and being the “go-to” / navigator, I can never really leave my family alone and I always feel some sort of resentment when I do leave (even when we have family in the places we go to, to help and direct them).

To make things a bit more complicated, my mother pays for these trips. I pay for my shopping and my days alone, but when I’m with them everything is paid for. (I consider this as my tourist guide fee and I don’t really demand to eat nor go to certain places if everyone really doesn’t want)

So recently, they decided that EVERYONE (for the first time) will go on one family trip. Not just the small pockets I’ve traveled with, but basically everyone in the family will go to one destination this year. Normally, I would jump in and go, but after the last trip, I’m feeling kind of burnt out. On the bright side, they decided to get an actual tour guide and bus. Unfortunately, I also don’t like tour guides and buses because everything is always rushed and we have to wake up very early in the morning. The clincher to this story is I actually went to this country before and I have no intention of going back again to its tourist spots. This country is known for its street food and good shopping areas and no way am I going back to the places I’ve been to before (tourist spots and whatnot) and not being able to explore different parts of this city. My mother is now guilt tripping me for not wanting to go, texting me every day asking if I’M REALLY NOT gonna go to the family vacation. It’s very frustrating, but I want to stand firm on this for my sanity’s sake.

When they saw that I was in bed and didn't clean everything they got mad at me. I tried to explain that I had a bad day and even tried to do it but couldn't. I thought at least my dad would understand since he had depression himself. 

But they didn't. They accused me of using my mental illness to get around things I was just too lazy to do and told me to do the rest. When I started crying because I felt like I couldn't do it they got even angrier and told me to just go back into my room.

We had a small wedding (30 guests), and weren’t super interested in a traditional style wedding.  I wore a purple dress, and we had no wedding party - no bridesmaids, groomsmen, ring bearer or flower girl.  He saw me in my dress plenty of times before the wedding.  

We also decided to walk down the aisle together, as a couple, rather than have my father walk me down the aisle.  We both loved the symbolism of the idea of “taking the journey towards marriage” together.  Also, the tradition of father walking the bride down the aisle has just never spoken to me.  Maybe it’s silly, but I didn’t really like the connotations/history of “giving away” or “transferring responsibility for” the bride.  Just, the history of the tradition didn’t sit well with me, even though I know it’s not like women being walked down the aisle by dad are seeing that as any kind of indication of “ownership” anymore.

There’s never been anything particularly tense between my dad and I, but we’re also not particularly close.  My parents separated when I was four, and when I was five my dad’s work moved him to a city about eight hours away from us.  I saw him 4-5 times a year, and that was always nice.  But I was raised by my mother.

My dad did not take it well, to the point that he was in tears and crying to my sister that he didn’t understand why I was doing this to him.  She sent me a long text message essentially saying I was being selfish for excluding him from the wedding and hurting him like that.  It was really awkward for me, and I ended up phoning my mother crying that my wedding plans were making my sister and father miserable.  The decision wasn’t at all intended to hurt my dad or exclude him, I just wanted a ceremony that was meaningful to me and my husband.  But I understood that it absolutely did make him feel excluded, and so I asked if he would like to be one of my witnesses.  He declined, saying it didn’t feel appropriate, and my witnesses should be my friends.

The wedding happened and there wasn’t any drama at it.  But the whole episode left me feeling bad, and like maybe I should’ve just ask my husband to do the traditional groom at altar, father and bride down the aisle thing.

Tonight she just texted me saying that it was an emergency and she needs me to burn her tattoo off as her parents won't pay for college if she has one. She's extremely paranoid about student loans and refuses to take any out so this is a big deal to her. 

I told her under no conditions am I burning her to take the tattoo off. It will fade in a year, it's unlikely her parents will see it, and frankly it's ridiculous that she's asking me to intentionally burn her to take it off. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea of holding a lighter to her ankle just to get rid of it or burning anyone in general. I don't even know if the tattoo will disappear after the burn heals. 

She's really upset with me for telling her that ""under no conditions am I burning you"". I told her she can ask her boyfriend or any other friends but it won't be me . She thinks I'm obligated to because I gave her the tattoo in the first place and her boyfriend will probably fuck up burning it off but I doubt I'm any more qualified to do that.

edit: she also refuses to burn it off herself? she says concealer isn't an option since she might forget and it will be obvious when she wears flipflops at the beach.  she's a little bonkers but this might be the craziest thing she's ever asked me to do.  

edit 2: apparently she's freaking out bc the tattoo means a lot to her since it was a friends thing but she doesn't want to risk college which understand. her new idea is to cut it off. idk how im friends w someone who thinks like this lmao.","1580433070.0","Not the A-hole","5","33"

When I was in my freshman year my ex roommate accused me of stealing 400 bucks from him that he apparently kept in the room. I didn't take it  and I didnt know he had it till he accused me but he grilled me and my friends (accusing them as well) over it for close to the remainder of finals weeks over it, basically for over a week. Part of this grilling included him threatening to ""break every bone in your body"" and even interrupting a date with my girlfriend to start the whole thing off. Even then when I ask for an apology next semester he openly lectured me over how I'm supposed to ask for an apology, yes im serious he told me to ave more social tact in asking for an open apology. And basically I had to argue for him to even try to apologize but it came of back handed as "" I'm sorry you feel that way"". Since then we weren't roomates, he supposedly found out who but apparently never grilled them over the supposed theft or reporting it to campus police. So basically I don't have to deal with him on a day to day basis any more. I've told other friend in my friend group about It but they still hang out with him, and I don't get in the way to say it's him or me. But he hangs around the group sometimes when I'm there and basically, I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for holding a bit of a grudge and never wanting him around my place even though he's friends with my new roomate? It's been close to two years, but every time I'm around him I do not like his personality or what he's done to me. I just want him away from me and my life.","False","Not the A-hole","3","9"
"ewfz1z","1580432425","AITA for not wanting to share a bed?","My brother and I are both gown adults in their 30's. My parents wanted to take one last family vacation this fall before my brother gets married next year. They also invited his fiancé. That'll make 5 of us. My parents are paying for the Airbnb, I'm paying for my flights, meals, etc.

My mom found the Airbnb and sent a link to us for our thumbs up: 3 bedrooms, 2 with a queen and one with a full. Naively I said it's perfect--my parents take a queen, my brother and fiancé take a queen, I'll take the full. I was naive because my parents are stubbornly conservative (a trait not shared by the rest of the family). My mom corrected me. No, I will be sharing a bed with my brother, and fiancé will have her own room because they're not married and ""we can't let that happen on our watch or our dime.""

I'm a bigger guy. I struggle to share a queen bed with my dog, let alone a full grown adult. This essentially means my brother nor I will be sleeping for a week. From my point of view, I will be lacking sleep and not be able to enjoy my time there because my mom can't fathom my brother and fiancé sharing a bed, even though they've lived together for a decade at this point. It just won't be an enjoyable time.

At this point I haven't refused the trip. I haven't demanded a larger house or separate accommodations. All I have done so far was express my concerns to my mom, express some mild frustration that she refuses to even consider a very simple solution to this, and tell her that ""sharing a hotel room and sharing a bed are very different.""

At this point she is mad at me for even bringing up my concern. I'm getting a lot of passive aggression and ""maybe we just won't go.""

To add to my frustration, my mom does a yearly trip with her cousins. This year their usual spot is closed, so their alternate destination means that she would have been sharing a bed with her cousins.....well guess what, she didn't like that and requested that everyone purchase their own room.

this sounds, really, really weird and childish on my part, but I swear I can explain.

My grandmother is a total health nut, and is equally obsessed with my health. Because I was halfway raised by her and my grandmother, she oversaw a lot of my childhood, and signed me up to sports classes (all the ones that could fit into my schedule), music classes, and also tried to “fix” my shyness and antisocialness in her own methods. 

I’m sure it was all with good intention, but it all backfired. I dropped out of every sport class, and now I really don’t want to go into one ever again because I associate them with the discomfort of being forced into a sport and environment against my will. Her ways to “fix” my shyness were to force me into awkward social situations whenever possible, which in the end only made me anxious to interact with others. I also dropped out of piano and now I find myself unable to find joy in learning music (which sucks, since I really want to learn a bit but I feel super uncomfortable when I try). I won’t say she shaped me in a negative way, since I’m sure her influence was minimal, but I do think the way she influenced me lead to many negative traits I have now.

The biggest issue I have is that she’s really obsessed with my body and weight. Because I dropped out of all sports, she seems to be scared that I’ll gain weight and become “ugly”. She’s expressed concerns that I won’t find a boyfriend if I “become fat”, and in general she seems to have a thing against overweight people in general (To nobody’s surprise I’ve had self-hate and image issues my whole life)

I’m 16 now, and the unofficial family failure in her eyes. She’s pretty much given up on me- I don’t practice any sports, I don’t play any instruments, and I’m not a social person. She also dislikes the fact I don’t want to have children, laughing in my face when I express my desire to live child-free. She’s also homophobic, and I’m bi myself, but not out to her, so hearing her make homophobic remarks around me is quite an experience.

In order to avoid arguing, I’ve taken to the most passive way I have to not listen to her, which is napping when I’m at her place. I really want to be on good terms with her, but it’s impossible to do so when all she talks about are things which make me hate myself, so I just take long naps when I’m at her house to avoid any problems between us. The problem is my parents think this is rude, and that avoiding her when she has pretty much helped raise me since I was a baby and pays half of my school’s tuition is incredibly ungrateful, and that I should just grin and bear it when she talks about all these things and indirectly calls me the family failure. I don’t want to argue with her, nor do I want to listen to her critiquing me, but they think I’m being an ungrateful brat for sleeping instead of being with her.

"ewgtsm","1580436028","AITA for trying to complain about a teacher","Background-(16m) I was in my chemistry class today and it was a pretty chill day when the principal had walked in the classroom, he took a seat and just watched the class do the work. It was at this moment that my teacher thought it was a good idea to start fiddling with the projector and take the work off the board. With nothing to do anymore, we just stopped working. When the principal had left I asked if she could put the work back on the board to which she replied “forget this, everyone’s taking a surprise quiz.” The class was stunned by this response and I wasn’t having it, but I played along. The teacher then proceeded to hand out a quiz with questions that we never learned nor she taught. We asked what to title this “surprise quiz” and she said to call it whatever we want and just get the quiz done because “I know chemistry and you don’t.” She followed the statement with a kind “if you don’t want to take this quiz then you can just leave.” So I left because I wasn’t going to be a part of this. I went to the main office to complain about her highly rude and unacceptable behavior as a teacher, and I talked to the assistant principal. The AP wrote me a referral for “progressive discipline” and told me I had CSI all day tomorrow. I never received a detention from that teacher nor the AP so I don’t understand why he skipped that step in progressive discipline.
